            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> that I intend to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, is <hi>a Union of Judgment and Practice in matters of Religion, and the Worſhip of God;</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with that mutual Love, and thoſe good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are the proper fruits, effects and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thereof. And by <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Worſhip of God,</hi> I mean the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and thoſe waies of worſhiping and ſerving the Majeſty of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60562:4"/>Heaven that are preſcribed unto us by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Laws, the Records whereof are in the holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>That this <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> is an excellent thing, is the confeſſion of all Chriſtians. Thoſe that do practically hate and abhor it, pretend a mighty eſteem and veneration for it; thoſe that deſtroy it, ſpeak much in its favour; and the moſt mortal Enemies thereof, will not fail to make its Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick, and exalt its praiſe. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> (who are certainly the greateſt Incendiaries and Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands that are upon Earth, and have for many years, yea ages paſt, and do at this time imbroil and fill all <hi>Europe</hi> with Confuſion and Diſorders, with ſecret Conſpiracies and Confederations, with open Wars, Violence, Oppreſſion and Rapine, are (as they would be thought) the moſt paſſionate Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and greateſt Admirers of it: But whilſt men ſee their fangs, and feel their paws, they will believe them Bears and Lions, though they ſhould avow themſelves the moſt harmleſs Doves or Lambs.</p>
               <p>But why is it that <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> hath the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſuffrage of men, even of thoſe that have a practical abhorrence and deteſtation for it? 'Tis its own proper Excellency and Advantages that commands their Approbations. <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> (as all other virtues) have their charms and attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives; and ſo great is the force of them, that men cannot behold and conſider them, without being inamour'd of them, and captivated by them. But though the excellency, lovelineſs and beauty of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60562:4"/>
                  <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> do ſubdue the underſtandings and judgments of men, their Intereſts, their Paſſions, and their Luſts, will not be conquered by any of them. Though <hi>Union</hi> be never ſo lovely in the opinion of their Conſciences, they will ſacrifice it a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times in favour to their Pride, their Ambition, their Covetouſneſs, their love of Empire, Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and other Luſts.</p>
               <p>Though the Commendations that are given to <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> be no proof of the virtue or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of thoſe that ſpeak in the praiſe thereof, yet 'tis an undeniable Evidence of its own proper worth and advantages. That which hath the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage and approbation of all mens Conſciences, that which hath the eſteem, and is the Darling even of its very Enemies, muſt needs be very excellent, worthy and valuable.</p>
               <p>The Excellencies and Advantages of <hi>Union,</hi> are moſt evident in the Cauſes of it, and in the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects that it produces in the World. <hi>Union</hi> is the effect of good Knowledge, &amp; ſound Underſtanding; (for that <hi>Union</hi> that is ſeen among the Ignorant, is no other than what is found in a heap of Logs or Stones, which doth not indeed deſerve that name.)</p>
               <p>Thoſe that fill the World with Controverſies, Quarrels and Contentions, are for the moſt part men of ſmall underſtanding, and of raw and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted notions. 'Tis half-witted people that ſet the Churches of Chriſtendom together by the Ears, and kindle thoſe flames in the Houſe of God, that are like utterly to waſte and conſume it. Men of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60562:5"/>great underſtanding are modeſt and peaceable; they will not contend for trifles, nor expreſs great Zeal for any thing, but the great Eſſentials of Faith and Godlineſs: They will not ſuſpend the <hi>Peace of the Church</hi> upon uncertain, or unneceſſary things. In things of that nature they can permit men to their Liberty, and where Liberty is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, there is ſeldom any Controverſie; but where there is unneceſſary reſtraint, there is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting quarrels, and will be to all Generations.</p>
               <p>Let me add further, <hi>Union</hi> is an effect of great holineſs and ſanctity of mind and nature. Let mens Knowledge be never ſo great, if they be not born of God, and partakers of a Spirit of Holineſs and Sanctification, they will quarrel and contend ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly, not in compliance with their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but in favour to their Luſts. If enquiry be made, 'twill be found true, that the holieſt perſons, and ſuch as have moſt of the Image of God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed upon their Sou's, are alwaies the moſt peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, quiet, and give leaſt diſturbance to the World; and what I have ſaid of Perſons, is true of Churches; thoſe Churches whoſe Members are moſt holy, moſt renewed, ſanctified and transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are the moſt freeſt from Diviſions, Quarrels and Separations.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Union</hi> is an Effect of great Self-denyal, Mortification, contempt of the World, and all the Pomp and Glory of it. This I do confeſs is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in what I ſaid in the preceding Paragraph; but that what I intend may be the more obvious
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60562:5"/>and apparent, I have choſen to diſcourſe it ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and by it ſelf. Men of unmortified Luſts and Paſſions, men that cannot deny themſelves in any thing, men that are fond of the World, and the Advantages of it, will never reſt, nor permit others to do ſo: They will move all ſtones, and make all tryals that they can imagine, will ſerve or advance their Pride, their Ambition, their Riches, their Honours, or whatever are their darling and be oved Luſts.</p>
               <p>Many of the Antient Schiſms and Hereſies, that ſo plagued the Church of God, were occaſioned by the Pride and Covetouſneſs of Churchmen. The Church continued for many years a Virgin. <hi>Thebuthis</hi> was the firſt that corrupted it with falſe Doctrine, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>SOmething having been ſaid of the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> let me add ſome few words of the <hi>Effects</hi> thereof, and but a few; for I intend no large or elaborate Diſcourſe. <hi>Union</hi> would make the Church ſtrong and impregnable, were the Members thereof united in and among themſelves. Were they of one mind, and one heart, they would ſtand firm like a Rock, againſt all the Aſſaults of their Enemies. For beſides their own proper ſtrength, which would be conſequent to their <hi>Union,</hi> God would ſtand by them, and be their Protector
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60562:6"/>and Defender. 'Tis Faction and Diviſion that weakens the Church, and cauſes God to withdraw his defence and guardianſhip from it; and then it becomes a prey to the Enemies thereof.</p>
               <p>Moreover, were the Church of God at <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> within it ſelf, it would be beautiful and lovely in the Eyes of the World. Did the Members thereof agree together; were they of one judgment in the Doctrines of Religion, and of one practice in the duties and actions thereof, how comely and decorous would the proſpect be? And how would it raviſh thoſe that behold and conſider it? even the very Enemies thereof would cry out and ſay, <hi>How beautiful are thy Tents</hi> O Jacob, <hi>and thy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles</hi> O Iſrael!</p>
               <p>Were the Church of God at <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Unity</hi> with it ſelf, it would be a mighty means to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the World, and bring it over to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion. Were there a great and mutual Friendſhip and Amity among the ſeveral Parts and Members of it, it would be a mighty Evidence of the Truth of Chriſtianity, and almoſt all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind would fall under the ſorce of it: The Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity thereof would be irreſiſtible; 'tis the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Feuds, the Diviſions, the Strifes, Hatreds and Contentions that are in Chriſtendom, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Churches thereof, that makes them a ſcorn and abhorrence to <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> as well as to the Atheiſtical and prophane that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. 'Tis the everlaſting Quarrels, and mutual Cenſures and Condemnations of each other,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60562:7"/>that makes Chriſtianity a poor languid thing, and takes off all the convincing power thereof in the apprehenſion of its Enemies.</p>
               <p>Again, were the Church of God united, and at Peace in it ſelf, the mutual offices of Love and Kindneſs, of Charity and Compaſſion, which would be exerciſed by the Members thereof, would very much ſweeten and abate the Miſeries and Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the preſent Life and State. The Rich would miniſter to the wants and neceſſities of the Poor, and the Poor would chearfully ſerve, and miniſter to the advantages of the Rich. According to their capacities they would mutually help and aſſiſt each other; and by theſe mutual offices of endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and kindneſs, much of the miſeries and infeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of Life would be removed, prevented, and ſweetened, and the World be a much more happy place than now it is.</p>
               <p>The holineſs of mens hearts and lives, would be very much encreaſed and advanced by <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi> Quarrels and Contentions do heat mens ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and fill them full of rancour, ſpite, malice and bitterneſs. It makes them fearful, jealous, and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of each other, and theſe kind of unhallowed paſſions do drink up their ſpirits, and poſſeſs their ſouls, inſomuch that they have no room or leiſure for the introducing of pious affections, holy habits, and a divine frame and temper of mind; whereas, were men at <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> they would be free of theſe Diabolical Paſſions, and would be at leiſure to trim and adorn their own Souls with the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60562:7"/>Ornaments and Perfections of Chriſtians: They would have time and opportunity to impreſs the Image of God upon them, and their communion in the Publick Worſhip of God would contribute great aſſiſtance to it.</p>
               <p>In fine, the Church of God on Earth would be ſome ſmall figure and reſemblance of the Church of God in Heaven, were it united, and did the Members of it live in Love and Peace together. <hi>There</hi> are no Diviſions or Separations; <hi>There</hi> are no Enmities, Variances, or Strifes. All love and ſerve God with one heart, and one conſent; all have a mutual love and kindneſs for each other. And ſomething like this would be ſeen upon Earth, if Chriſtians and Churches would, or could unite and live in Amity and Peace. But alas, <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> ſeem to have forſaken the Earth; and ſome men ſeem reſolved, that they ſhall never return again, the conditions they propoſe for the reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it, being utterly impracticable, as ſhall be ſaid and proved anon.</p>

               <p>THE Excellency and Advantages of <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> being ſuch as I have mentioned, (to which many more might be added) it will eaſily be granted, that all Chriſtians are obliged to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the obtaining of it. Things ſo worthy and excellent, ſo profitable and advantagious to King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Nations, to Cities, Towns and Villages,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60562:8"/>Families, and ſingle perſons, to the Bodies and Souls of men, certainly ought to be proſecuted with utmoſt might and endeavour; it ſhould be <hi>ſought as Silver, and ſearched after as fine Gold.</hi> All juſt and prudent means ſhould be eſſayed for the attaining of it.</p>
               <p>Our Intereſt, as well as our Duty, layeth on us the greateſt obligations to ſeek and purſue <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Unity.</hi> The love of our ſelves, and our own advantages, as well as the many Precepts, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Exhortations of Jeſus Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, ſhould make us earneſt and zealous in our labours to obtain it. Strife and Contention, Diviſions and Factions, deſtroy and take away all the comforts and pleaſures of life, and are great breaches of the Divine Commandments; yea they are a mighty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and ſcandal to the Chriſtian Religion, and huge pleaſure and gratification to the Devil, that great Enemy of God and Men.</p>
               <p>And ſurely methinks, if men would but give themſelves the liberty of a little ſober conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they ſhould not with ſo much earneſtneſs, obſtinacy and zeal offend God, miſchief and undo themſelves in time and eternity; for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than to pleaſe the Devil, and gratifie ſome bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh and prophane paſſions, which have him for their Author and Original. But men will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, or if they do conſider, they adviſe with their luſts, but not with their reaſon; with their paſſions and prejudices, but not with their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and thence 'tis, that the effect of their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60562:8"/>conſideration is many times more pernicious and prejudicial to <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union,</hi> than if they had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally neglected it. For 'tis impartial Reaſon, and well inform'd Judgment and Conſcience, that ſpeak in the favour of <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Peace;</hi> but Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and Pride, Love of Riches, Empire, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Dominion, are for Faction and Diviſion: They are for ſetting the Church (and the World too) in a flame, hoping to make ſome advantage thereby.</p>
               <p>Theſe things peradventure will be granted by the moſt of men; thoſe that are the greateſt Dividers will acknowledge the excellency of <hi>Peace,</hi> and the duty and obligation of labouring after it; they will confeſs that it is the Intereſt of Mankind to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and obtain it, and to adviſe with their reaſon, and not with their paſſions, when they conſider how it be may recalled and reſtored again to the Church of God, and Societies of Men. They will alſo grant, that there is fault ſomewhere, and that ſome men are to be blamed, that there is ſo little <hi>Amity</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> among Chriſtian People and Churches; and that it is become ſuch a mighty difficulty to heal the breaches of Chriſtendom, and to compound the Differences that are in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Parts and Kingdoms of it.</p>
               <p>But although all men will acknowledge that the fault lies ſomewhere, yet there are none of the Contending Parties that will lay any blame at their own doors. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and ſome of their Writers ſeem to bewail
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60562:9"/>the Diviſions and Factions that are in the Chriſtian World; but that they are no cauſe of them, they do avow with all the aſſurance imaginable. The <hi>Calviniſts</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> do alſo confeſs and bewail the Diviſions among Proteſtants; but they will both proteſt that they are not the faulty Cauſe thereof. To come nearer home, the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> and <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> do ſufficiently confeſs, and many of them I believe, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Differences that are among us; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them will acknowledge themſelves worthy of any blame: They are both Innocent in their Opinions, but both Faulty in the Opinion of their Adverſaries.</p>
               <p>But peradventure an imprejudiced and unbyaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spectator, (if ſuch a one be to be found) may think that there are Faults on both ſides, among the ſeveral Factions of Chriſtendom, though not equally great. The <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> without doubt, are the greateſt Make-bates that are upon Earth, and the moſt Faulty Dividers; and yet I believe that there are ſome Proteſtants that make the Difference greater in ſome things than really it is, betwixt us and them. And there is no man that ſhall calmly read the Late Theſes of the Learned <hi>Le Blank,</hi> but will be ſatisfied of it. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> certainly are much to blame in ſeparating from the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and ſpeaking and writing ſo bitterly and ſpitefully concerning them: And yet 'tis poſſible that the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> may not be altogether Innocent; for amongſt them alſo are found men of unyielding
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60562:9"/>ſpirits, and ſuch as lay too much weight upon ſmall things. As for the Contentions among our ſelves (if I may be pardoned the liberty of ſaying it) I do not doubt but we are all to blame.</p>

               <p>NOW the great Cauſe (in my apprehenſion) of all the Diviſions, Quarrels, Schiſms and Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are in the Chriſtian World, is the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and impoſing things unneceſſary, doubtful, difficult, unintelligible, unprofitable, and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, the Conditions of Church Communion. This hath rent and torn the Church of God in pieces theſe thirteen hundred years; and yet thoſe that are the Guides and Governours of Churches, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cannot, or will not ſee it. Let the Hiſtories of the Church be conſulted, and this may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily obſerved. What is it that divides the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Churches from each other? What is it that divides the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches among themſelves? What is it that divides the <hi>Roman</hi> Churches from thoſe of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Profeſſion? What divides the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts?</hi> What is it that divides the <hi>Chriſtian People</hi> of this Nation? Is it not the Impoſing of things doubtful, dark, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and unneceſſary, and this with a pertinacious and inflexible rigour, and ſeverity one againſt another?</p>
               <p>Do not all theſe Churches agree in the great Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials of the Chriſtian Religion? Do they not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60562:10"/>all believe the common Articles of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith?</hi> Do they not all believe the <hi>Lord's Prayer</hi> to contain the ſum and matter of all the Requeſts that we are to make to God? Do they not believe the <hi>Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to comprehend the main, if not all thoſe Duties that we owe to God and Men? And are not theſe things in which all agree, ſufficient for the <hi>Union</hi> of Chriſtians? Might they not live together in Love, notwithſtanding their other Differences? Or, though they could not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate together (as indeed <hi>Proteſtants</hi> cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the <hi>Romiſh Churches</hi>) might they not maintain <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> under diſtinct Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions? Might they not repute each other <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Churches,</hi> though not equally ſound and perfect? Theſe things me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, might be done, were it not that a Spirit of Impoſition, and Arbitrary Domination over the Judgments and Conſciences of Men, hath poſſeſſed the Guides of Chriſtendom; All men muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and think, and ſpeak, according to their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, or elſe they are no Chriſtians. Their Judgments, yea ſometimes their Prejudices, and their Dreams, muſt be made the Conditions of Communion; and if any refuſe to <hi>ſwear to their words,</hi> and will ſee with their own Eyes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and practiſe according to the Light of their own underſtandings, they are Hereticks, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the Name and Communion of Chriſtians.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60562:10"/>And hence proceed the various Separations and Diviſions, and all the direful and tragical Effects of them, which have made the Chriſtian World a <hi>Bedlam,</hi> and ſometimes a Field of Blood, to the reproach of Chriſtians, to the ſcandal of Infidels, and to the perverting of many Profeſſors of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity to Atheiſm, or Apoſtacy to ſome other falſe Religion.</p>

               <p>TO preſs this a little, Whoſoever conſiders the great variety and difference that is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Human Minds, muſt find that Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of many doubtful, and unneceſſary things is no proper means of preſerving <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> in the Church of God, eſpecially among <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> where a judgment of diſcretion, or a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of believing, according to the convictions of our own minds, is confeſſed the undoubted right of every Reaſonable Man. Is it imaginable that Men whoſe underſtandings are almoſt of as various degrees and ſizes, as are the ſhapes and figures of their faces, ſhould agree in the ſame ſentiments and perceptions concerning things dark, doubtful, and unneceſſary? Is it imaginable that all Chriſtians ſhould have the ſame thoughts, and make the ſame judgment concerning the Determinations of the Council of <hi>Trent?</hi> Is it conceiveable that all the Chriſtians in <hi>England,</hi> or all the Clergy in <hi>England</hi> ſhould have the ſame conceptions, and entertain the ſame Opinions concerning the Doctrine, Diſcipline,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60562:11"/>and Liturgy of this Church? To me it ſeems altogether as improbable, as that twenty thouſand blind Men ſhould from twenty thouſand places, move and march, and at laſt meet together, and put themſelves in good order on <hi>New-market</hi> Heath, or the Plains of <hi>Sarum.</hi> And why ſhould Impoſitions be made, where there is no probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or indeed poſſibility of Aſſent unto them? Or are ſuch Impoſitions, which make Diviſion in <hi>our Church,</hi> a likely means of making <hi>Peace</hi> in the Churches of <hi>Chriſtendom?</hi> He that can believe it, may with as much reaſon believe that the caſting on fewel and combuſtible matter, is a means to extinguiſh a furious raging flame; or the way to preſerve a Ship from ſinking, is to commit it to the Wind and Waves without any Pilot or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſit at the Helm, and manage the Courſe of it.</p>
               <p>That the gradual Difference of Mens Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, is very great, and almoſt infinite, cannot reaſonably be denied. Parents, Teachers of Schools, Tutors, and all kind of Artificers, find it ſo in the Experience of every day. It hath been ſo in all Ages, and will be ſo for all that I can ſee, as long as the World endures. Whether there be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality among Souls; or whether this great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety proceeda from the differing mixtures of the Elements, that compound our Bodies, and out of which our Organs are made, I will not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, though I incline to believe the former; for 'tis paſt my imagination to conceive how the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60562:11"/>mixtures of ſenſleſs Elements or Atoms, ſhould produce all that variety that is obſervable in the Underſtandings of Men from the greateſt States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Philoſopher, or Divine, to the meaneſt Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, or the moſt blockiſh Dolt.</p>
               <p>Parents firſt find a vaſt difference in the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of their Children; ſome of them are of quick and pregnant Wit and Ingeny; they eaſily receive and apprehend whatever is propoſed to them; others are dull and heavy, and receive with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty ſuch things as are offered them for their Learning and Knowledge. Some of them are capable of underſtanding ſome things, whereas of other things they are as uncapable almoſt as the verieſt Idiots. The Experience of Schoolmaſters next, is much the ſame: Some of thoſe Children that are committed to their care, do readily learn and receive whatever they reach and inform them: Others with difficulty and much labour. Some can never be brought to learn any thing that is regardable, by all the care and endeavours in the World. Tutors at the Univerſity find the like variety among their Pupils. Some Youths hear their Lectures, and underſtand and remember the Contents of them; and if they be examined con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, will give a good and fair account of them: But others hear them, but neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, nor remember almoſt any thing of them; and if the ſame things be repeated over again, with all the clearneſs that can be expreſſed by words, yet they ſtill remain without Knowledge or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60562:12"/>therein. You may as well think to draw a Cable through the Eye of a Needle, as to impreſs Learning upon ſome mens Minds. Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Mechanicks ſpeak the ſame Language, and give us the ſame Informations. Some Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices eaſily learn the Arts that they profeſs; others do it with great difficnlty, and are but bunglers at the laſt. <hi>Non puede ſer mas negro el cuerbo que las, alas,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Proverb, <hi>The Crow cannot be blacker than her wings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as the Degrees and varieties of Mens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings are vaſtly great and many, ſo are their prejudices and Anticipations. Some perſons ſuck in certain Opinions with their Milk; they receive them from their Parents, and ſuch as give them their Education. Thus ſome are prejudiced for the Doctrine of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and others for the Doctrine of <hi>Aaminius;</hi> thus ſome perſons are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced for <hi>Epiſcopal Government</hi> in the Church, and others for a <hi>Presbyterian Parity:</hi> Thus ſome contract a kindneſs for a pompous and ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Religion, and Way of Worſhipping God, others contract a fondneſs for a very plain and and ſimple Way and Method of Worſhip and Devotion.</p>
               <p>Moreover ſome men read but one ſort of Books, and care not to read any thing that is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in oppoſition to their Anticipations; or if they do read any thing of that nature, 'tis with ſo great a prejudice, that their judgments are rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed than altered thereby. They are ſtrongly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60562:12"/>perſuaded of the truth of their own apprehenſions, &amp; what is intended to ſhake them, doth but (as the Wind by Trees) fix and eſtabliſh them. That this is a fault I do eaſily grant, but 'tis eaſier to obſerve than cure it; and that mens prejudices are ſtrangely fixed and confirmed thereby, cannot be denied.</p>
               <p>Beſides, men are ſtrangely prejudiced againſt ſome Opinions, by the infamous reports that have been raiſed concerning thoſe that have defended and maintained them. Thus the Papiſts are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced againſt the Doctrine of Proteſtants, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent and frontleſs Lyes, that have been raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and other great inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Reformation: And thus many among us have an Implacable Pique and Diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Diſſenters and all their Opinions, becauſe ſome men do report them a company of ſeditious People, that can never be quiet, but are always libelling Authority, and diſturbing all Order and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments whereſoever they live. And others are as much prejudiced againſt Epiſcopacy, and the peculiar Opinions of that ſort of men, becauſe they are reported to be a generation of men, that are proud and imperious, lovers of Empire and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that engroſs the Revenues of the Church, and employ them in Luxury and Senſuality, but care not for the Souls of men. If they will obey the Orders of the Church, and ſubmit to its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, they may defie all the Laws of God, and without reſtraint or control make what haſte
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60562:13"/>they pleaſe to Hell; they countenance the Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Prophane, and perſecute and oppreſs ſuch as fear God, &amp; tremble at his word; they are impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of ſuch Meetings and Aſſemblies, where a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of poor Chriſtians meet together, to hear Gods Word, and call upon his Name; but they can very patiently bear the Aſſemblies of rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Senſualiſts and Blaſphemers, that convene to defie God, promote their own Damnation, and of as many others as they can.</p>
               <p>Again, ſome Perſons receive prejudice againſt Opinions, from the real faults of ſome ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or a few men that have embraced and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them. Some Diſſenters have uſed ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely, indecorous, and unadviſed Expreſſions in their extemporate Prayers, and therefore they reproach and reject all extemporate Effuſions: ſome of them have preached Doctrine not agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſome mens conceptions, or have uſed homely Language and Similitudes, and therefore all their Mouths muſt be ſtopped, and the Church of God will do better without them than with them. Some Conformiſts read the Liturgy without any ſeeming ſeriouſneſs or Devotion, they are in ſuch haſte to have done with it, that they can ſcarce give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves time enough to pronounce the words in their full extenſions, and therefore they infer that all forms of Prayer are inconſiſtent with, and enemies to Devotion, and good for nothing, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Lazineſs, and introduce Formality, and a kind of Lifeleſs Worſhip of God.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:60562:13"/>
               <p>Another thing that ſixes mens prejudices, is their worldly Intereſt and Advantage, this is that which is the ſtrength of the Papacy, and the ſupport of the Antichriſtian Hierarchy and Kingdom. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are by their Education ſeaſoned and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued with the Opinions of that Church, and their Intereſt confirms them in the belief of them. When they come to the uſe of their Reaſon, and a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of judging concerning them, men do ſeldom embrace Opinions that are inconſiſtent with their worldly Advantages, or forſake thoſe (though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo unreaſonable) that do favour and advance it. By believing the Doctrine of that Church they poſſeſs Eſtates and Honours, they live in Eaſe and Peaſure, and exerciſe Dominion over the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men; and theſe things are pleaſant to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Natures and corrupted Minds, and by them men are charmed and bewitched into a Belief of the wildeſt and moſt unreaſonable perſuaſions in the World. 'Twere impoſſible to hold the Members of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to a belief of its own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, were there no worldly Intereſt to biaſs and ſway their Judgments thereunto; Biſhopricks and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacies, Caps and Miters, and the many Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Advantages wherewithal <hi>that</hi> Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds, do more to preſerve it than all the Power of Princes, yea than all the writings of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt learned Champions of that cauſe. And 'tis not only in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> beſides, that Intereſt doth either form mens Opinions, or fix their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipations,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60562:14"/>and make them ſteddy and immutable therein.</p>
               <p>The variety of mens Underſtandings and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, being thus obviouſly great and many, how is it poſſible that there ſhould be <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> among Chriſtians, if Church Communion be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon the belief and acknowledgment of doubtful and unneceſſary things? May not their concord with as much reaſon be ſuſpended upon a ſimilitude of faces, features, and proportions?</p>

               <p>BUT I ſhall argue the improbability of it, from Experience, as well as from its proper Cauſes. Do we not ſee great variety of judgments, and apprehenſions in all parts of Learning and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? Do not Grammarians differ in the ſenſe and meaning of words, and in the explication of the Idiotiſmes and peculiarities of the learned Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges? Do not our Mythologiſts differ in the account they give of the Fables of the Greek and Latine Poets? Do not ſome Learned Men think that they are (at leaſt many of them) corruptions of the true Hiſtory of things which we have in the Holy Bible? Hath not the Learned <hi>Bochartus</hi> among others given very probable reaſons for it? and hath not an Engliſh Doctor and Divine of our Church derided, and laughed at him for it?</p>
               <p>Have not, and do not our Theological Criticks and Tranſlators differ in their Opinions, even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Signification of words, as about the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60562:14"/>Original of them? Is there any agreement or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord among them, or do we need to go far for proofs of it? The firſt verſe in the Bible will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with enough. ברא שית <hi>In the beginning</hi> is tranſlated by the <hi>Jeruſalem Targum,</hi> בחוכמא <hi>in Wiſdom,</hi> By the Arabick <gap reason="foreign">

I will only mention the different opinions of Criticks, upon thoſe words, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 22.17. <hi>They pierced.</hi> The word כארי <hi>ſome</hi> think is derived from the Hebrew word כרה, and that the Aleph in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle is Epenthetical, and the Jod in the end of the word is put for Vau, either by the negligence of Tranſcribers, or the fraud of the Jews out of ſpight to the Chriſtian Religion: Others think the radix of the word is כהר, and that Aleph is put for Ajn, by a permutation uſual in the Eaſtern Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages: Others think that the word is Syriack, and that the radix is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and that 'tis here the infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Mood with the affix of the firſt Perſon, which often admits the ſignification of the preter perfect Tenſe among the Hebrews.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is of the ſame ſignification
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60562:15"/>with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as <hi>Ferrarius</hi> informs us. Other diverſities of opinions there are concerning this word, thoſe that pleaſe may conſult <hi>De Dieu, Glaſſius, Hottinger, Amama, Pocock,</hi> in <hi>Porta Moſis,</hi> with many others.</p>
               <p>Are there not great diverſity of opinions among Hiſtorians and Chronologers? do they give the ſame account of things? is there no diverſity in their narrations? Do the Greek and Roman Hiſtoriographers, report the ſame things of the Emperours, great Generals, and men of War, whoſe lives and actions they tranſcribe, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmit to future Ages and Generations? Do they fix the ſame Epoches, and Periods to the beginning and end of the four famous Empires that have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded each other in the world? Are they agreed in what year of the <hi>Julian</hi> period to fix the Creation, or how long it hath been exiſtent? <hi>Longomontanus</hi> reckons it exiſtent. 3964. <hi>Kepplerus</hi> 3993 years before the birth of our Lord. <hi>Ricciolus</hi> ſays in his Almageſt that he hath proved in his Chronology that this duration of the world could not be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded farther than 4076, nor determined ſhorter than the year 3993, from the Nativity of our Lord; And the moſt probable year of the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſpace betwixt theſe two periods he thinks is the year 4063. See <hi>And Tacquet. Aſtron. lib.</hi> 1. p. 46. This is enough to prove the variety, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of Chronology, to which many more might be added, if it were to any purpoſe.</p>
               <p>When will our Learned Commentators agree in their expoſitions of the dark and obſcure parts of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60562:15"/>the Scripture? When will they give the ſame ſenſe of the Prophecies of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Revelations?</hi> Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> ſeems to have given the faireſt account of them, and yet the Learned Dr. <hi>More</hi> diſſents from him in many of his interpretations, as well as from Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and his admired <hi>Hugo Grotius.</hi> And 'tis not only among Chriſtian Writers that this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity is found, but even among the Jewiſh Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors: I ſhall only give one inſtance thereof amongſt numberleſs numbers that might be produced: and that ſhall be from their expoſitions of the 53 Chap. of <hi>Iſaiah. Abravanel</hi> in his enquiry concerning the Subject of that Prophecy tells us, that many of their Wiſe Men underſtand it על פשיח לעחיר לבא <hi>de Meſſiah venturo</hi> and thus <hi>Paehmanides</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands it: <hi>Rabbi Saaidias</hi> underſtands it of <hi>Jeremy</hi> the Prophet, and ſo doth <hi>Aben Eſra</hi> and <hi>Rabbi Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachem,</hi> with whom <hi>Grotius</hi> aſſents, though not without ſome heſitation. <hi>Jarchi</hi> and both the <hi>Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi's</hi> (Father and Son) underſtand it of the Jewiſh Nation, which opinion he embraces and defends. <hi>Vide eum ſi placet in Commentariis fol</hi> 78. The like diverſity is found among the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> as thoſe that pleaſe may find in Mr. <hi>Pococks ſpecimen Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae Arabum,</hi> and his notes upon it, as alſo in <hi>Hottin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers Hiſtoria Orientalis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When will the diverſity of opinions concerning the Hebrew Points receive a determination? <hi>Capellus</hi> in his <hi>Arcanum punctationis</hi> aſſerts the novelty of them, ſo doth our Learned <hi>Walton. Buxtorfius Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi> aſſerts them in his <hi>Anti Critica, Capellus,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60562:16"/>his opinion with acrimony and ſcorn enough towards his adverſary, as may be ſeen throughout his whole defence; <hi>Buxtorfius</hi> replies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and the Controverſy is not yet ended, nor I think like to be. Theſe things Create no diſputes among Carpenters and Maſons, among Plough-men and Carters, and Perſons that live in an utter igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of them, but they are, and will be contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies among the Learned, till <hi>Elias</hi> come.</p>
               <p>And are there not as many controverſies, varieties, and uncertainties in natural Philoſophy, as in what I have already mentioned? are not all things variouſly argued there, and are not mens Judgments in thoſe matters as multifarious as their Perſons in them? Have not <hi>DesChartes,</hi> and ſome other Philoſophers of late overturned the whole Syſteme of the Ariſtotelian Philoſophy, and may not others do the like by what they have eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and are there not as great objections lying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Novel Syſtemes, as againſt thoſe that they have rejected? Or are the minds of ingenious, and inquiſitive men any more ſatisfied in the one, than in the other?</p>
               <p>Are Phyſicians agreed in the nature of Simples, Drugs, and Minerals? have they any fixed Method for the Cure of Diſeaſes? are they agreed in the Nature and Cauſes of them? Can they tell what cauſeth Convulſions, and Epilepſies? Are they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, or ſatisfied in what Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> hath diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed concerning them? Do they know what cauſes an Ague, or in what part of the body, and in what
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60562:16"/>veſſels thereof that <hi>Fomes</hi> lies, which at ſtated times ferments, and produces thoſe various Symptomes? Are they agreed in their judgments about theſe things, or are they ever like to be? Do we not find new methods of Curing Diſeaſes propounded every day, which after they have had their turn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Stage, they go off, and others ſucceed them.</p>
               <p>As the varieties in natural Philoſophy are many, and the differences among thoſe that converſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in innumerable, ſo are there the like among the Writers and Students in Metaphyſicks. What is there in that Science that is not variouſly argued and diſputed? When will they be agreed about the Principle of Individuals, about the nature &amp; number of Cauſes, about Quantity, Habits, Relations, and other things paſt count and number? When will they with one conſent tell us the difference between the Decrees and Eſſence of God, whether it be real virtual, relative, or by extrinſick denomination?</p>
               <p>To theſe varieties and differences in Science, add thoſe that are found among Mathematicians in Aſtronomy, and other parts of Mathematical Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. When will they be agreed about the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter and Circumference of the Earth, when will they tell us how many miles we muſt move North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ere the pole be elevated one degree higher than 'tis in the place of our preſent abode and habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? When will they determine the quantity of the paralacktical Angle of the Sun? Is it two degrees, or three degrees, and ſome prime minutes, as <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegnius</hi> will have it; or is it only 14 or 15, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60562:17"/>as <hi>Vendeline</hi> determines it; or at the moſt but 30 ſeconds even when the Sun is neareſt the Earth as <hi>Tacquet</hi> reſolves it? <hi>Aſtron lib.</hi> 3. p. 131. 132. When will they fix the diſtance of the Sun and Moon from the Earth, and from each other? when will they determine the nunber of the Earths Semidiameters, by which theſe diſtances may be meaſured? when will they agree in the height and extenſion of the Atmosphere, and how much the Diameter thereof exceeds that of the Earth, in its length and extenſion? when will they conſent in the proportion that the ſeveral planetary Orbs have to each other, with many other queſtions of like nature and uncertainty, too many to mention?</p>
               <p>If the variety of mens Judgments in matters of Humane Learning and Philoſophy be ſo great, it cannot reaſonably be expected, that they ſhould be one and the ſame in the Doctrins of Religion. There are as great depths, and as many unfathomleſsabyſſes in Religion, as in any part of Learning or Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; and indeed thoſe very things that are difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Religion, at leaſt ſome of them, are not pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Chriſtianity, but were the ſame before it was known in the world, and are indeed difficulties in Philoſophy, as much as in Religion. Such are the difficulty of reconciling the Divine Preſcience and Decrees with Liberty &amp; Contingence, or the Liberty of mans will with the Infallibility of Gods; Such is the original of Evil, and many things about the nature and acts of God, and therefore whil'ſt there are controverſies and obſcurities in the one, there
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60562:17"/>will be in the other. The things themſelves being mixed and blended, the obſcurities that attend them muſt be mingled and confounded alſo.</p>
               <p>In brief; There is nothing but a profound Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance that can make Men of one Judgment (pardon the expreſſion, for 'tis Catachreſtical and improper) in the obſcure, dark, and unneceſſary Doctrines of Religion. This is obvious among the Papiſts themſelves; for though the common People, which are kept in Ignorance, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to read the Bible, manage no Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies concerning Points of Religion, nor are divided in their Judgments about them; yet their Learned Men are at as great Differences, and there are as great Feuds among them, as among Proteſtants, unleſs it be in ſuch things where their Intereſt unies them. This is ſufficiently known by all Learned men, what everlaſting Quarrels there are between the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and <hi>Dominicans,</hi> the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> and <hi>Moliniſts,</hi> and many other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders among them; inſomuch that his infallible Holineſs himſelf durſt not determine them, for fear of diſobliging the one or the other Party of them.</p>
               <p>Ignorance indeed keeps men quiet, and free from raiſing Controverſies, and running into vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Judgments. Plough-men &amp; Carters, do not uſe to differ about the ſignification of words in the Greek, Hebrew, and Oriental Languages, but Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſts do, and will everlaſtingly differ about them. Tradeſmen and Farmers have no Debates about the paſſing of things out of a State of Poſſibility
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60562:18"/>into a State of Futurity; or whether there needs a Decree of God for the effecting of it. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Haberdaſhers are not divided in their Opinions about the variation of the Sun's fartheſt declination, the mutation of his Excentricity, or the unequal Motion of his Apoge. Theſe are things they pretend no knowledge in, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they entertain no diverſity of Sentiments concerning them: But Aſtronomers have been of different Judgments in all theſe things, as may be ſeen in the Author lately quoted, <hi>pag.</hi> 45. 37.</p>

               <head>SECT. VIII.</head>
               <p>YET after all that I have ſaid to evince the Improbability, or rather Impoſſibility of Union among Chriſtians in many things, eſpecially ſuch as are dark and doubtful, and of little uſe or neceſſity, I do not intend to affirm that Chriſtians can agree in nothing, or that all Uniformity of Judgment is impoſſible and impracticable among them; no, I do with much aſſurance ſay, That Chriſtians may, do, and will agree in all the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and Conſtituent Parts of Chriſtianity, and that Peace and Love may be maintained notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very great variety of Opinions, and ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent practices too in other things.</p>
               <p>That Chriſtians will agree in the great Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of Chriſtian Religion, is apparent; for they do ſo, <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> with all the ſeveral Subdiviſions that are among them, do conſent in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60562:18"/>one Common Creed, Rule of Life, and Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of Prayer and Devotion; all <hi>Proteſtants, Calviniſts, Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> or by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other title they may be known or called, conſent with them in the great <hi>Agenda, Credenda, &amp; Petenda</hi> in Religion. In theſe things there is no diverſity among them; thoſe things are ſo obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the Scripture, and many of them in the Light of Nature, and by the Providence of God have been ſo ſuperintended, that in the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Church, and Apoſtacy of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, the knowledge and belief of them hath been preſerved and continued amongſt all.</p>
               <p>Yea I am paſt doubt, that if only theſe things were made the Conditions of Communion among Chriſtians, with Liberty of Difference in other things, and ſome variety of practices in particular Churches, more Unity, Peace and Love would thereby be produced, and Knowledge, Piety and Godlineſs be more advanced than by any other means in the world. In the daies of the Apoſtles, and in ſome Ages after them, perſons were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Chriſtian Church, upon their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and conſent to theſe few plain things; yea up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a bare conſent to the Contents of the Baptiſmal Covenant; and whilſt they continued that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Faith, they were continued in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Chriſtians; and I do not yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand why men may not be Chriſtians, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the Communion of Chriſtians upon the ſame terms now as then; I think the Apoſtles
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60562:19"/>were as wiſe men, and knew as well what they did, as any that have come after them in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church; and I do not as yet ſee any reaſon why their Laws and Conditions of Communion ſhould be altered. I am afraid the alteration of them hath done more hurt, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned more miſchief to the Church of God, than they that were the Authors thereof will be able to give a fair account of to God Almighty one day.</p>
               <p>It is not to be doubted, but that there was great diverſity of Opinions (and ſome diverſity of Practices) in things of inferiour nature among Chriſtians, and among Churches, even in the Primitive Church; The Jewiſh and Gentile Converts had not the ſame Opinions, nor were not of the ſame Judgment; Some differences there were among them, both in Opinion and Practice, as is obvious in the Scripture: And St. <hi>Paul</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it, and communicated with them therein. And thus it was in the Ages ſubſequent to the Apoſtles, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> reports from the Letter of <hi>Ireneus</hi> to <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. <hi>Victor</hi> had Excommunicated the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Churches, becauſe they would not obſerve <hi>Eaſter</hi> after the <hi>Roman</hi> manner, for which <hi>Ireneus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France</hi> reproves and admoniſhes him not to Excommunicate and Cut off whole Churches, for obſerving the Tradition of their Fathers; for they had alwaies obſerved it on the fourteenth day of the Month, and would not change it, to comply
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60562:19"/>with the <hi>Roman</hi> Cuſtom, who obſerved it on the Lord's Day. <hi>Ireneus</hi> tells <hi>Victor,</hi> That there was not only a Controverſie about the Time of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving <hi>Eaſter,</hi> but alſo about the Obſervation of the Faſt that did precede it; ſome thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to obſerve one, ſome two, ſome more, and ſome forty Daies; and this variety was not a Novel Cuſtom lately introduced, but had been ſuch long before in the Times of their Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Predeceſſors; but this brake no Peace, though they differed about the Number of the Daies of Faſting. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The diverſity of the Faſt did commend the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of Faith.</hi> He adds that <hi>Hyginus, Anicetus, Pius, Zyſtus,</hi> and <hi>Teleſphorus,</hi> which Ruled the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> before him, though they never obſerved <hi>Eaſter</hi> after the Cuſtom of the <hi>Aſiatiques</hi> nor permitted it to be done in their Church, yet they kept Peace with thoſe that came to them from other Churches where it was ſo obſerved; and gives inſtance in <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> who being at <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Anicetus,</hi> was treated by him with Love and Honour, and permitted to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate the Euchariſt in his Church: And if Biſhops and Church-men, were as humble, pious, &amp; peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as thoſe two Biſhops were, there might be the ſame Peace among them and their Churches, though they differed in ſome Cuſtoms, Practices, and Obſervations.</p>
               <p>I know no more reaſon that Biſhops and Churches ſhould quarrel one with another for the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60562:20"/>ſake of ſome differing Opinions and Practices, than that they ſhould quarrel about the difference in their bodily ſtrength and ſtature (I have inſtanced in the face before) or the various ſorts of Faſhions and Ornaments wherewith they are covered and adorned. Were it not a pleaſant thing to obſerve men huſſing, and raging, anathematizing, &amp; curſing each other, becauſe one wears brown coloured Cloth, and another wears Gray; one wears Serge, and another Freeze; one buckles his Shoes, and another ties them with Strings? And are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Contentions of Chriſtendom indeed founded and eſtabliſhed upon Reaſons of equal weight and value? Are not moſt of the unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Feuds and Heats that are in <hi>England,</hi> of this ſort and kind? What if one man fits at the holy Sacrament, another ſtands, and another kneels? Is not a Unity of Affection and Faith reconcilable with this diverſity of geſture? What if one man reads his Prayers, and another repeats them from his Memory? What if one man uſes a Form, and another prayes Extemporately? may they not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Common Faith, and live in Love and Peace together? I am ſure this may be, and if it be not ſo, 'tis not hard to tell what is the reaſon of it, nor where the blame muſt be laid.</p>
               <p>If Peace and Love may be preſerved, amidſt ſome diverſity of Opinions, in the leſſer things of Religion, and ſome variety of Practices, alſo (as I am very ſure it may, if nothing elſe do hinder it) it may be hoped that the Chriſtian world may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60562:20"/>ſome quiet once again, and loſt Charity, Love and Kindneſs may revive among the Diſciples and Servants of the God of Love and Peace; but if nothing will ſatisfie the Guides and Rulers of Chriſtendom, but Uniformity in all things; and no Liberty be given for ſome diverſities of Practices, there will be, nor can be, any Peace or Concord upon Earth; for Chriſtians never will agree in many things; nor is it morally poſſible they ſhould, as I have evinced (I ſuppoſe) at large al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
               <p>The truth is, the idle Dream, the fond Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a poſſibility of making Chriſtians of one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Judgment and Practice, hath filled the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world with variance, ſtrife and contentions, with blood, violence, rapine, and oppreſſion, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions and baniſhment: Yea hath left little more than the name of Chriſtian Religion in moſt parts of the world. For that men may be of one Judgment and Practice in Religion, there muſt be Impoſitions, and theſe Impoſitions muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by Laws, and the contempt or breach of theſe Laws muſt be penal, and thoſe penalties muſt be ſharp and ſevere, and ſeverely executed, and ſo bring us to ſuch a paſs, or elſe they are only Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, and men will laugh at them, and differ ſtill as much as ever.</p>
               <p>And ſure it is, that men fearing God, will not debauch their Conſciences, nor ſin againſt God, they will not hazard their Souls to preſerve and ſecure their Lives, their Bodies, and their Eſtates;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60562:21"/>they will not run the hazard of being damned everlaſtingly, to eſcape the temporary puniſhment of impoſing and domineering Rulers and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and therefore they muſt be impriſoned, fined, baniſhed, hanged, and damned too, if it were in the power of their good Friends and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors to do it. And theſe are the bleſſed Effects of Tyrannical Impoſitions; theſe the means of Peace, Union and Concord among Chriſtians and Churches. But I would fain learn who taught them theſe means, waies and methods of Peace, Unity and Concord. Of all the Creatures upon Earth, a man would ſuſpect they learned it from the Devil, who was a murtherer from the beginning; ſurely they never learnt them from the holy Jeſus, for he never uſed any ſuch methods of Peace, nor taught any ſuch to his Diſciples that I can find in the Goſpels. <hi>Ye know not what manner of ſpirit you are of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what follows? When they have baniſhed, ruined, burnt and murthered all the Diſſenters of one Age, the next Age furniſhts them with more, to exerciſe their Cruelty upon, and imploy their Rage which they call by the name of Love and and Zeal for Union and Peace: And thus for the maintenance of their Impoſitions and an Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Peace by the means thereof, they are obliged to live in perpetual War, and to maintain ſome Legions in conſtant pay, to ruine and deſtroy thoſe which are much better than themſelves, and dearer to God and Chriſt, as they may alſo dearly
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60562:21"/>know when they come to account to him for it.</p>
               <p>But if they chance to ruine all Diſſenters, and none ariſe in ſucceſſion to them, then muſt men grow to a careleſneſs &amp; indifferency in all Religion; they ſhall retain the name, and perform and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ſome of the exteriour parts and formalities thereof, but as for the Power of it, and a conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious reverence and veneration for the Authority and Laws thereof, they are utter ſtrangers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Impoſitions and Proſecutions upon the breach of thoſe Laws that do enforce them, puts a period to all ſearch and enquiry; it gives a check to all endeavours after an Encreaſe in Knowledge: For if men uſe the means thereof, they will differ in their Sentiments and Apprehenſions, and thoſe differences will expoſe them to the publick Rods and Axes; and therefore they muſt grow utterly negligent therein, chuſing rather to be ignorant with ſecurity, than to obtain Knowledge to their ruine and deſtruction; and whatever puts a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to all endeavours after Knowledge and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding doth certainly ruine and deſtroy the Power of Religion. For Ignorance introduces Irreligion, Formality, and Superſtition, but is no Mother to, or promoter of true, internal, hearty Religion and Devotion. And this is one of the diſmal Effects that Impoſitions and Laws for the inforcing of men have had in Popiſh Countries, eſpecially in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> There's nothing left in thoſe Countries, but the name of Chriſtianity, and ſome outſide Formalities of Worſhip and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60562:22"/>they know nothing of the Power of it: And I am not without fears, that if the preſent Impoſitions in <hi>England</hi> be continued, and the Laws proſecuted, and Diſſenters ruined and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed thereby, that (unleſs God raiſe up others) the Life and Power of Religion will decay, and Tepidity, Formality, &amp; Indifferency, with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Senſuality and Prophaneneſs ſucceed thereunto.</p>
               <p>And really, ſuch a State peradventure may be acceptable enough to ſome men; for ſo they may live in Plenty and Peace, and have what may careſs their ſenſes, and pleaſe and gratifie their luſts, they care not much what becomes of the Honour of God, or the Souls of Men. Thus 'tis in Popiſh Countries; the Pope and his Cardinals, the Biſhops, Abbots, and moſt of the Clergy, live in Honour, and at eaſe; they abound in all things that are grateful to the Fleſh; they withhold not their hearts from any Joy; but whether the People ſerve God or the Devil, whether they be ſaved or damned, is very little their concernment. Let them believe as the Church believes; let them be obedient to the Orders thereof; let them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance no Opinions contrary to its Inſtitutions, and for other things they are at liberty, and may do as they liſt. There is no ſin like Inconformity, and breaking the Orders and tyrannous Impoſitions of the Church. They may break all God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with more ſecurity than any one of them. Some there be do not fear to ſay, That there are
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60562:22"/>others in the world that are much of the humour of thoſe Catholick Gentlemen; and many there be that do not know very well how to confute them.</p>
               <p>Let it not be ſaid that I impute all ſeriouſneſs in Religion, to variety and differences of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Opinion; I mean no ſuch thing. I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to an encreaſe of Knowledge, and skill in the Scriptures and Doctrine of Chriſtianity, to which diverſity of Opinions, and ſome diverſity in Practices too is, for ought that I can ſee, unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; nor is there any way of preventing one without the other. This the Papiſts ſee well enough, and therefore forbid the Reading of the Scripture to the Vulgar; and ſome Proteſtants ſee it too. See Biſhop <hi>Bramhall</hi>'s Vindication againſt Mr. <hi>Baxter, who ſhall ſcape fairly</hi> (he ſays) <hi>if none caſt it in his teeth, that the promiſcuous licence which they give to all ſorts of people, qualified or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified, not only to Read, but to Interpret the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture according to their private ſpirit, or particular fancies, without any regard either to the Analogy of Faith which they underſtand not, or the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Dectors of former Ages, is more prejudicial, I might better ſay pernitious, beth to particular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and to whole Societies, than the over rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous reſtraint of the</hi> Romaniſt. <hi>p.</hi> 116, 117. There are more may ſee it in due time, and 'tis to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, that thoſe that commend that Book, and have eſpouſed ſome other notions of that Author, concerning Patriarchal Power, and the Obligation
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60562:23"/>to obey the Laws of Univerſal Councils, till they be repealed, (which how they ſhall be I cannot tell) may have ſome kindneſs for the ſame Opinion, and ſome illuminations concerning it, though it be too early in the morning, as yet to propoſe them to publick Conſideration.</p>
               <p>However I have entertained the perſuaſion which I think I am not ſo like to forſake, that Knowledge with ſerious Piety, and Godlineſs, though mixed with ſome real Errours, Diviſions, and Miſtakes (for in variety of judgment concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame things all cannot be true) is more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, than Union, and ſameneſs of apprehenſion, with Ignorance, Prophaneneſs, Formality, and a form of Godlineſs without the Power of it. A living man, though ſomething miſhapen and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, is better than a lifeleſs Statue, though it be never ſo beautiful and comely; and moſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had rather have their Children alive, though by their little pieviſh humours and quarrels, they give them ſome trouble and vexation, than to be deprived of them, having nothing but their pict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures and lifeleſs Marbles, which never need their Umpirage to reconcile their animoſities and waſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh feuds.</p>

               <p>BUT what means all this Diſcourſe? Why this is the meaning of it. <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> among Chriſtians is a very fine thing, and greatly deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60562:23"/>but ſo various are the Underſtandings, and ſo great and inveterate are the prejudices of men, that Union of Judgment can never be expected, with any probability, unleſs in a few, plain, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things. <hi>Peace, Union,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> was preſerved in the Chriſtian Church in the <hi>Primo</hi>-Primitive times, upon ſuch terms, upon the conſent unto, and agreement in a few plain, neceſſary things. Thoſe were thought then ſufficient, and they are ſo ſtill, though the belief of it be periſhed from among men. Thoſe perſons that ſuſpend the Peace of the Church, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many dark, uſeleſs, and controverted Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Doctrines, and will proſecute all Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by ſevere and ſanguinary Laws, (I will ſay it over again) do but take a fair way to deſtroy the Church of God, and leave nothing but the emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Name of Religion in the World.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, What then would you have? Would you have all men left at liberty, to believe and do as they liſt in Religion? Would you have no Laws or Rules be impoſed upon the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Faith of men? Shall they be permitted to believe and publiſh what Doctrines they pleaſe? Before I make any Anſwer to this Objection, I ſhall with all humility beſeech both our Civil and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Governours, eſpecially the latter, (whoſe Government certainly is paternal) that before they make Laws and Rules for the Conſciences of men, they would a little conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Weakneſs, Impotence, and Depravtion of humane Minds.</hi> Methinks thoſe that govern
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60562:24"/>the Churches of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> ſeem to have very little ſenſe of the common Calamity of Mankind; they ſeem to have forgotten the great and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Imperfections of the whole poſterity of <hi>Adam:</hi> Are not the Underſtandings of moſt men pittifully blind and dark? Are they not ſtrangely impotent and weak, yea, unable to diſcern ſometimes the cleareſt Evidence and Light? Are they not ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly influenced by Education, Company, Intereſt, and many other things? Do not mens Luſts and Paſſions very much influence and ſway their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellects? And are not their apprehenſions of things very much formed by them? This I do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is a fault, but 'tis a common fault, and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome conſideration ought to be had of it, in the making and impoſing Laws and Creeds, upon the Conſciences of men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The very great Trouble, Tiranny, and Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſcrupulous Conſcience.</hi> They that have had to do with thoſe kind of perſons, know ſomething of it, but none underſtand it fully but thoſe that have had experience thereof. The bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, the trouble, the anguiſh, and the torment of it is not to be expreſſed; the ſeverity of its Laſhes, the rigour of its Rule and Dominion, is almoſt inſupportable. Perſons of this temper there have always been, and will be, and though ſome incompaſſionate men, (whoſe Bowels ſeem to be made of Braſs) laugh at them, and ridicule their tenderneſs and ſcruples, yet I do belive that Church-Governours (who ſhould be Fathers to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60562:24"/>their People) ought to have ſome reſpect unto them in their Conſtitutions and Impoſitions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The impoſſibility of moſt mens giving aſſent with judgment to things controverted, difficult and obſcure.</hi> Let men ſay what they liſt, 'tis not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that makes moſt men aſſent either way in the difficult controverſies of Religion. Do moſt men, yea moſt Clergy men, give their aſſent in the controverſies between Remonſtrants and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra-Remonſtrants, out of conviction of Judgment? No: Thoſe things are of ſuch profound and deep Speculation, that very few men have either leiſure, Books or Brains to fathom them, and make a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them. The Controverſie about the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Biſhops and Prebyters, whether it be a difference in Order or in Degree, requires ſo much reading and skill in ancient Authors, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Councils, with the debates of Neotericks, that many men are not able with any ſettled judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to determine on the one ſide or the other. T'is true, that ſome of the Church have lately, with great confidence, without diſpute, concluded a difference of <hi>Order</hi> between them, and we muſt now believe it with as much aſſurance as the Apoſtles Creed: yet I ſee no juſt reaſon to doubt, but that the Controverſie will remain longer than our Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, &amp; peradventure there may have been, and ſtill are as great men, and as well skilled in ancient Learning, as the late and preſent Biſhops, that are of the contrary perſuaſion. I might inſtance in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Controverſies at this time, but this ſhall
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60562:25"/>ſuffice, for I am perſuaded, that all men that have impartially ſtudied, and thought of theſe matters, and made obſervation on the underſtandings of men, muſt acknowledge, that very few men of free judgments, can be brought to a full agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in controverted and obſcure points of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And as fo the moſt conſequently, that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to what is impoſed becauſe they muſt, they do generally ſubſcribe to things which <hi>Combien entiendan come puerca de freno, they are as well skill'd in as a Sow in a Bridle,</hi> as ſays the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The incongruouſneſs of Laws, Penalties, and Executions, to make men wiſe, or give them large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of underſtanding, to bring them to this Concord.</hi> Will Laws and Penalties give Eyes to the Blind, or Ears to the Deaf? Or will they enable a weak and impaired Eye to ſee Hairs, or the Webs of Spiders? Will they enable the quickeſt. ſight to ſee the Woods and Forreſts, the Rocks and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the Towns and Villages, the Caſtles and Forts that are in the Moon? Laws and Penalties may ſometimes put men on ſtudy and conſideration, (though I think 'tis not very often, they rather warm and enrage mens Spirits, and put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the defence of their own Opinions, than on the conſideration of the truth of thoſe that are impoſed on their aſſent and Faith) but they can never make men underſtand beyond their Capacities: All the Teaching and Inſtruction in the World will not make ſome men wiſe and learned, and what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction can't do, I am ſure Laws will not do.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:60562:25"/>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>That Laws and Executions may make ſome men Lie and Diſſemble, and Conſent againſt their Conſciences to Impoſitions: but of all men ſuch are the ſharpeſt and moſt inraged Enemies;</hi> And none upon Earth will be more ready to revenge themſelves upon the Impoſers, than they will be, whenever an opportunity be offered to them. Thus in the Daies of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, and aſſented to the <hi>Roman</hi> Impoſitions, to preſerve their Eſtates and Lives, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their Old Opinions, and conceived a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal hatred againſt thoſe that put them on thoſe ſtraits and difficulties, as Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> obſerves (<hi>Hiſt. Refor. part</hi> 2. <hi>page</hi> 364): And there is no doubt but they were the keeneſt, and moſt eager Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> in the Daies of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> when they had the opportunity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging themſelves upon them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That <hi>it is not impoſſible, but the ſame meaſure that ſome mete to others, may be meaſured to them again; and that thoſe that Impoſe upon the Faith and Conſciences of others, may be Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon themſelves with the ſame, yea far greater Tyranny and Rigour.</hi> The Papiſts are endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſubvert our Government and Religion; they have had Deſigns upon the Perſon and Life of our Soveraign, and ſome men think they ſtill have; and I know no reaſon to imagine that they have forſaken them, unleſs they be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in their Judgments that there is no poſſibility of proſpering, or being ſucceſsful therein, which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60562:26"/>why they ſhould be, I confeſs I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. 'Tis true, a man would think they ſhould find mighty difficulties in accompliſhing their Plot, but it muſt be conſidered that we have been, and ſtill are a ſinful Nation. We have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly provoked the Majeſty of Heaven, and whether or no for the ſake of our Iniquities, God may not give us up into the hands of our Popiſh Enemies, I cannot tell; I am ſure we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it; and if he hath determined to puniſh us for our ſins, by delivering us up to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Scourge and Tyranny, 'tis to no purpoſe to talk of difficulties; they ſhall be the Rod in his hand, and he will chaſtiſe us in deſpite to all the oppoſition that we can make againſt it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That <hi>God who is the great Sovereign and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the whole Univerſe, does ſuffer or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit many things in this Inferiour World, which he doth not approve, propoſing himſelf a Pattern to Rulers.</hi> God ſuffers much among Heathens and Infidels, much among profeſſed Chriſtians, yea and many things he paſſes by in thoſe that are truly his Children; <hi>He knoweth their frame, he conſidereth that they are but duſt.</hi> God is not ſevere, nor doth puniſh every fault and miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage among mortals; and ſurely thoſe that are his Vicegerents here on Earth, and repreſent him, would do well to imitate the Example of the moſt Supreme Lord of all; or at leaſt I think 'twere not amiſs to be as equally ſevere againſt Atheiſm, Prophaneneſs, groſs Immorality, and a contempt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60562:26"/>of all Religion, as againſt ſome ſmall Errours in Opinion and Differences in Practice, from the Eſtabliſhed Doctrines and Methods of Divine Worſhip preſcribed. Eccleſiaſtick Rulers (whoſe Government I have ſaid is paternal) are more eſpecially obliged to conſider this, foraſmuch as they are, or at leaſt ſhould be, beſt acquainted with the underſtanding of the Patience, Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering and Forbearance of God: But all ſhould conſider it, foraſmuch as all have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of it, and muſt have, or they are undone. Civil and Eccleſiaſtick Governours both have experience of much Indulgence and Connivance from God Almighty, and they have ſtill great need of more; and 'twere well that they which enjoy and need ſo much, would impart and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate ſome degree and meaſure of it towards others.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That <hi>the requiring of greater Uniformity in Opinion and Practice in the things of Religion, than the Church of God is capable of, is no means of Union, Peace, or Concord, but a moſt effectual and certain means of Diviſion, Separation, Strife and Contention.</hi> The Chriſtian World hath found this true by ſad and lamentable Experience, and there is no man of ſenſe or brains, but may eaſily perceive it, if he apply himſelf to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. Were it a likely way to promote Peace in a Kingdom, yea or in a ſingle Town or Village, to oblige all the Inhabitants thereof by Laws, Penalties and Executions, to learn and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60562:27"/>ſpeak the <hi>Greek,</hi> the <hi>Chaldee,</hi> or the <hi>Arabick</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and no other? Are they capable of it? or have they Time, Leiſure, Wit, or Helps ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to obtain a skill and dexterity in it? Have they Teachers to inſtruct them in the meaning, reading and pronunciation of it? Or ſuppoſing they had Teachers, Have they all of them oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, leiſure, or capacities for it? Would this make Union, Peace, or Concord amongſt them? Or would it not certainly mutiny, trouble and divide them? No more is it any probable means of making Peace, Union, and Concord among Chriſtians, to oblige them to think, ſpeak, and do the ſame things, in the many doubtful and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Caſes and Points of Religion and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in agitation among us? Are their minds all of the ſame ſhape and ſize? Are they all of equal capacity and comprehenſion? Yea, are the minds of all Clergy-men of equal quickneſs and perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity? Are they of the ſame vigour? And have they the ſame advantages for the improvement and cultivation of them? Or are Impoſitions like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to unite them? Or are they not rather a ſure Means, and certain Engine of Diviſion and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? 'Tis morally impoſſible that men ſhould have the ſame thoughts and apprehenſions in the Controverſies of Chriſtianity, as I have ſaid and proved in the preceding Diſcourſe; and if the Governours of Churches will require things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, they may eaſily perceive that it is not the way to make Peace, but War; not Union,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60562:27"/>but Diviſion; not Love and Friendſhip, but Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, Variance, and Strifes: For though ſome will aſſent to all that they require, out of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and for their Advantage; others, by the hope of a fair and paſſable Interpretation; others will run with the Herd, and ſwallow all without any chewing or conſideration; yet there will be men of tender, ſcrupulous, and ſevere Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that will everlaſtingly diſſent from them. I do humbly conceive ſome regard ought to be had to ſuch perſons by Governours in their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and that thoſe that are moſt afraid of offending God, ſhould not for that very reaſon be expoſed to the greateſt Sufferings and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That <hi>it ſeems ſomething hard, that it ſhould be in the power of Church-Governours (who have all their Power for Edification, not for Deſtruction) to make men Schiſmaticks at their liſt and pleaſure; and yet ſo it is, if they may Impoſe what Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, Doubtful, and Unneceſſary Doctrines and Practices they pleaſe, upon the Belief and Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men.</hi> If this be granted, thoſe that are Good and Catholick Chriſtians this day, may be a company of Schiſmaticks to morrow; 'tis but the Impoſing of ſome Doubtful Opinions on their Faith, and ſome Suſpicious Actions upon their Practice, and the work is done. And on this Suppoſition 'tis come to paſs, that all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. World are by ſome part or other thereof, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Schiſmaticks. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> account
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60562:28"/>all Schiſmaticks, that refuſe and diſſent from their Impoſitions. The Proteſtants are of ſeveral Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and various Practices, and are more than enough ſevere in their Cenſures of each other. Some ſeem to account all thoſe Churches Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, that have no Biſhops, or Epiſcopal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination; others think them Schiſmatical that do aſſert the neceſſity of it, and will Impoſe the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and Practice thereof. The Caſe being thus, an honeſt and ſober man would be ſhrewdly tempted to think, that God never gave any Power to Church-Governours to Impoſe Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Unneceſſary things upon the Belief and Practice of Chriſtians, and thereby make Schiſms, Separations and Diviſions at their pleaſure; but that all the Power they have, is to Command and Impoſe things plain, neceſſary, and certain; and that thoſe are enough to maintain the Churches Peace.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That <hi>it ſeems very hard alſo, that men that believe all the Antient Creeds, aſſent to all the Fundamental Articles of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and live a pious and holy Life, denying all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, living righteouſly, ſoberly and godly in this world, ſhould be denyed the Communion of the Church: And yet thus it may, and thus it doth happen, by reaſon of the Impoſition of ſome Doubtful and Unneceſſary things.</hi> Thus 'tis in <hi>England;</hi> let a man be ſound in the Faith, and live an Angelical Life, in the exerciſe of all kinds of Chriſtian Virtues, yet if he ſcruples
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60562:28"/>Kneeling at the holy Sacrament, he may not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in it; if he doubts the lawfulneſs of Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Godmothers, or the uſe of the Sign of the Croſs in Baptiſm, he may not have his Child Baptized, or admitted into the Church of God, though he be a perſon ſound in Judgment, and of unblameable and exemplary Converſation in all Godlineſs and Honeſty. No Clergy-man can of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate in the Church, that ſuſpects or doubts any thing in the Liturgy, Book of Ordination, and Articles, to be contrary to the Word of God; beſides ſome other Subſcriptions which a think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man may be able to find ſuch difficulties in, that he cannot anſwer to his own ſatisfaction. Be his Abilities never ſo great, be his Deſires to ſerve God in the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus never ſo warm, lively and paſſionate; yea though he have been ſolemnly devoted thereunto, he muſt not come near the Altar, nor meddle with any Publick Miniſtrations, for the promoting the Honour of God, and the Salvation of Souls. The greateſt skill in Languages and Philoſophy; the largeſt knowledge in Fathers, Councils, Hiſtories, and the latter Books and Writings of Divines, joyned with uncorrupt Faith, and an unblemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Life, are not ſufficient qualifications for the Prieſthood. The Impoſitions muſt be all ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, or the Candidates for it may go feed Swine. For the Flocks of God (which he hath purchaſed with his own blood) they ſhall not feed, though there be no others to ſubſtitute in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60562:29"/>the Room of them, and they wander, go aſtray, and periſh eternally by the want of Teachers and Inſtructers.</p>

               <p>HAving beſought our Civil, and moſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially our Eccleſiaſtical Governours, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe few things now diſcourſed, I proceed to make ſome Anſwer to the Objection; <hi>What would you have?</hi> And in general I reply, I am no Advocate for Univerſal Liberty, that men ſhould be left to believe, ſpeak, and do as they liſt. I would not that permiſſion ſhould be given to any to blaſpheme God, ridicule the Chriſtian Religion, decry and burleſque all Morality, and laugh at the day of Judgment, and a State of Rewards and Puniſhments. I would not that men ſhould be permitted to Preach Rebellion, and Mutiny the People againſt their Prince; nor that they ſhould be allowed to ſow Sedition, or teach ſuch Doctrine as will ſubvert Order, and deſtroy all Peace among men; for theſe things, and others of like nature, I am no Patron. Let theſe be prevented by all juſt care and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and let ſuch as offend in any of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the ſharpeſt puniſhments.</p>
               <p>But <hi>in particular,</hi> for ſatisfaction to this grand Query or Objection, as being the chief buſineſs of my undertaking, I humbly propoſe theſe ſeveral things which follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That nothing be Made or Impoſed as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60562:29"/>of Communion, but a few plain, obvious and neceſſary things. In theſe Concord among Chriſtians may be expected, and will be found, but in many Doubtful and Unneceſſary things it is impoſſible. Grammarians, Hiſtorians, Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philoſophers, and Mathematicians, agree in ſome things. There are certain Axioms, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notions, and Propoſitions, in which they do mutually conſent, whatever their Differences be in thouſands of other things. In ſome few, great, plain, and uſeful things, Chriſtians do and will agree, though in many things of leſs certainty, uſe and importance, they may and will differ to the worlds end. <hi>Exiſtimat ejus Majeſtas nullam ad incundam concordiam breviorem fore viam, quam ſi diligenter ſeparentur neceſſaria a non neceſſariis; &amp; ut de neceſſariis conveniat, omnis opera inſuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, in non neceſſariis Chriſtianae libertati locus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Epiſt. Cauſaboni ad Card. Perronium. p.</hi> 31.</p>
               <p>Let the things Impoſed as Terms and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Communion, be the Great, Eſſential, and Conſtituent Parts of Chriſtianity: Let them be ſuch as are of the Eſſence of Religion; ſuch as without Aſſent and Conſent unto, no man is, or can be a Chriſtian. That Religion (I mean the Chriſtian Religion) hath its Eſſential and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent Parts, cannot reaſonably be denyed; for if it have no Eſſential Parts, 'tis not <hi>Quid Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum,</hi> 'tis no compound thing, which no man in his wits, I think, will affirm; and if it be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound thing, it muſt have its Eſſential Parts,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60562:30"/>diſtinguiſhable from thoſe that are Integral and Accidental. We are not to be tyed up to the one as to the other. <hi>Certainement il ſeroit bien à deſirer qu'il n'yeuſt pour tout aucune diverſité, ni bigarrure entre les fideles à cet regard. Mais parce que dans l'infirmité, où nous vivons en cette chair mortelle, ce bon heur eſt plus a ſouhaiter, qu' à eſperer, il fant reſtreindre la neceſſité de l'union de nos ſentimens aux poincts, qui ſont Eſſentiels, &amp; ſans la creance des l'on ne peut parvenir au ſalut. A leur égard, tous les fideles doivent ſentir une meſme, choſe. Nulle ne peut y avoir de diverſité ſans rompre. Mais quant aux auters, qui ne ſont pas de cette importance, nous devons y ſouffrir la diverſité quand il y en a l'example de l'Apoſtre, qui oblige bien ci apres tous les fideles à cheminer d'une meſme ragle en ce a quoy ils eſtoyent parvenus, mais ſupporte neantmoins ceux qui aux reſte ſentent quelque choſe autrement que luy,</hi> &amp; <hi>les fideles parfaits, eſperant que Dieu le leur revelera auſſi. Comme vous voyez, que dans un eſtat, pourveu que tous les citoyens tiennent les maximes fondamentales, &amp; neceſſaires pour la ſanction des devoirs eſſentiels à ſa conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, l'on tolere entre eux de la diverſité en pluſieurs autres ſubjects de moindre importance.</hi> Daille on Phil. 2.2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let the Eſſential Parts of Chriſtianity be ſo carefully collected, that there be no defect, nor no redundance: Let there be no defect, leſt ſuch perſons as are no profeſſed Chriſtians, be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Communion of the Church: Let
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60562:30"/>there be no redundance, leſt thoſe that are true Chriſtians, and believe all the Eſſentials of the Chriſtian Religion, be excluded and denyed their proper Priviledge and Right. <hi>Jacobus Acontius</hi> diſcourſing of a Common Creed to be uſed among all Chriſtians, and to be reputed the Teſt and Condition of Communion, ſpeaks as followeth. <q>
                     <hi>Ac oportet quidem confeſſionem ejuſmodi eſſe inſtar definitionis cujuſdam, quemadmodum enim requiritur, ut definitio neque plura complectatur, neque pauciora, quam res ipſa, quae definitur;</hi> (viz.) <hi>ut nihil deſit, nihil redundet: ita in fidei ſymbolo nihil deeſſe oportet eorum quae ſunt ad ſalutem cognitu neceſſaria; nil etiam contineri debet, abſque cujus cognitione contingere ſalus poſſit: Si deeſſet etenim aliquid cognitu neceſſarium, fieret ut qui Chriſtianus haberi non debuit, neque Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae Dei Membrum, propterea quod profiteretur illud ſymbolum, haberetur pro Chriſtiano. Sin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineretur Symbolo aliquid non neceſſarium cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu, uſu venire poſſet, ut qui confiterentur quae eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent neceſſaria, ut qui cum ſuâ qualicunque fide ſalvi eſſe poſſent, propterea quod non reciperent id abſque cujus cognitione contingere ſalus poſſit, cum eſſent pro Chriſtianis &amp; Eccleſiae membris agnoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendi, rejicerentur; at ſineque deſit, neque redundet quicquam, jam neque rejicerentur, niſi qui ſunt rejiciendi, neque recipientur, niſi qui ſunt recipiendi, atque ita aptiſſimum fuerit Symbolum, quo Chriſtiani à non Chriſtianis diſcernuntur.</hi>

               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:60562:31"/>
               <p n="4">4. Let ſome difference be made between a Confeſſion of Faith, and a Summary or Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtian Religion. In a Confeſſion of Faith let nothing be inſerted which is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation: In a Chriſtian Inſtitution all things may be diſcourſed which may be thought any way uſeful or advantageous. Whatever is mentioned in a Creed Symbol on terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, beyond what is abſolutely neceſſary, breaks the Church of God into Sects and Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and fills it full of quarrels, ſtrife and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Thoſe that will promote the Peace of it, muſt require Aſſent and Profeſſion only to ſome few neceſſary things; and in vain do men hope or expect, that the whole Church of God ſhould be of the ſame mind in many or all things. <q>
                     <hi>In confeſſione ſcribendâ, ut nihil quod omnino ſit cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitu neceſſarium praetermittendum eſt: ita quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid addatur non neceſſarium (etiamſi alicqui ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum &amp; bonum ſit) id ad Eccleſiae diviſionem in Sectas pertinet, atque ad diſcordias &amp; rixas; qui pacem &amp; concordiam in Eccleſia vult eſſe, oportet eum rerum neceſſariarum confeſſione contentum eſſe; fruſtra enim ſperaverit aliquis fore unquam, ut cum Dei Eccleſia tam bene agatur, ut de rebus omnibus omnes idem ſentiant; quare una illa reliqua eſt concordiae ratio, ſi qui neceſſaria am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plectuntur, ferant ſe mutuo, &amp; ſuas controverſias inter ſe amanter, humaniterque uti fratres, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctent.</hi>
                  </q> Acont. ubi ſupra. pag. 367.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let this Confeſſion, Creed, Symbol, or Teſt of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60562:31"/>Communion be expreſſed, as near as poſſible, in the words of Scripture. <q>
                     <hi>Nihil complectatur niſi ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſum eiſdem etiam verbis, &amp; loquendi formulis (quoad ſciri poteſt) quibus ipſe Dei Spiritus uſus eſt:</hi>
                  </q> For there may be many men that will own and ſubſcribe a Creed, or Confeſſion, expreſſed in the words of the Holy Ghoſt, which peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may ſcruple that which is expreſſed in our own. All Proteſtants do grant, that all things neceſſary to be believed and practiſed, are plainly and clearly revealed, and expreſſed in the holy and ſacred Volumes. What hinders then, but that our Symbol, Creed or Confeſſion, may be drawn up in the words of Scripture? Do we imagine that our own words will be more apt and proper, and fitter to obviate Hereticks than thoſe of the Holy Ghoſt? Shall we pretend to be more wiſe and cautious than the Divine Spirit? Or do we know what is more or leſs liable to Cavils and Exceptions better than God himſelf? What ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance, madneſs, and preſumption is this? Are we wiſer than God? Or are we more prudent and adviſed than he whoſe underſtanding is infinite?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Let nothing be condemned or rejected in this Creed or Symbol, but what is inconſiſtent with the Faith of things abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation. Let no Errours be condemned in it, but ſuch as exclude from the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. If Errours of inferiour nature be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, 'twill become an Engine of Diviſion, and not an Inſtrument of Peace; 'twill exclude many
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60562:32"/>from the Communion of the Church, which ought to be received unto it, and ſo be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Separation and Schiſm. And I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing almoſt that hath occaſioned more miſchief, and brought more fatal Calamities upon the Churches of Chriſt, than the enlarging of Creeds and Confeſſions, under pretence of obviating Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Hereſies. This one Engine hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed more Schiſms and Separations, and ſhed more blood, and cauſed more deſolations than all the Heathen Perſecutions; and yet notwithſtanding the Lamentable Experience of ſo many Ages, 'tis ſtill kept in uſe: And I believe the Devil is very loth to part with it; he hath found ſuch ſucceſs and advantage by it, that he will never forſake or abandon the uſe of it, if poſſibly he can: And there are many men (and ſome that do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be no Friends to him, or his Intereſts) that ſeem to be almoſt as loth to part with this bleſſed Invention as the Devil himſelf. <hi>Optandum foret ut qui publica templa &amp; mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera occupant, in ſua confeſſione, doctrina, ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niis, aliiſque ſe intra primorum Chriſtianorum &amp; Apoſtolorum ſimplicitatem &amp; generalitatem conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerent, aut duodecim illis Catholicae Fidei Articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, Symbolo Apoſtol. contentis, hoc eſt paucis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modum, &amp; paucis ceremoniis, contenti eſſent, &amp; in aliorum conſcientias Dominium non uſurparent, adeo ut omnes abſque animi offenſione publicos illos coetus frequentare, &amp; ibi inter ſe Euchariſtiam celebrare poſſent.

               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:60562:32"/>
               <p n="7">7. Let us know that, the things abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, and utterly inconſiſtent with it, are but few. The Learned and peaceable Author laſt but one mentioned, reckons nothing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly neceſſary, but Faith in the Son of God; and nothing inconſiſtent with it, but Unbelief of the ſame proportion. By conſequence he grants it neceſſary that we underſtand the depravation &amp; guilt of our own lives and natures, and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and reſolution of God to judge the Living and the Dead. <hi>Vid. Jac. Acont. Strat. Satanae, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>à pag.</hi> 123. <hi>ad pag.</hi> 131. And according to theſe apprehenſions of things abſolutely neceſſary, both directly and by conſequence, he forms a Symbol, which I will propoſe to the Reader's view and conſideration in his own words.</p>

               </list>
               <p n="8">8. Let the Miniſters of the Goſpel be obliged to declare their Fai h in, and Aſſent unto, no more than ſome ſuch brief Symbol, or Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or rather to thoſe three Summaries of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity aboveſaid. Let them not be obliged to ſubſcribe unto a multifarious number of Articles, or to profeſs a Faith or Conſent unto them. Let them heartily believe thoſe few great things, and reduce their Faith to Practice, and perſuade o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (I mean their ſeveral Congregations) to do ſo, and this will be a more effectual way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing and preſerving Peace and Union, than any other way or means whatſoever, and with leſs miſchief and inconveniencies. 'Tis true, good, large, numerous and ſwinging Impoſitions, rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by ſevere Laws, and proſecuted by ſomething like an Inquiſition, would peradventure ſilence more Diſputes and Controverſies; but then there are two ſmall miſchiefs conſequent thereunto, The one is, it would deſtroy the beſt part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from off the face of the Earth: The other is, it will deſtroy all ſerious Religion, and leave
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60562:34"/>nothing but an empty name or ſhadow of it in the World. And I am of the mind that ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Religion, though attended with Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies and Contentions about ſome ſmaller things, is more eligible than no Religion, or an outſide Formality and Vizour of it, though accompanied with the greateſt Agreement, Union, and Same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Judgment and Apprehenſion imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. <hi>Men are not Maſters of their own Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and cannot change their Thoughts as they pleaſe. He that believes any thing concerning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, cannot turn as the Prince commands him, or accommodate himſelf to the Law, or his preſent Intereſts, unleſs he arrive at that pitch of Atheiſm as to look on Religion only as a matter of Policy, or as an Engine for Civil Government. Burnet</hi> in his Preface to his late Book of the Right of Princes.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Let Miniſterial Qualifications be ſet as high as prudently they may: Let them be required to have good Skill in the Learned Languages and Philoſophy: Let them be skilled in Hiſtory, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that of the Church: Let them know ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Controverſies of Religion, and in the Writers of the Primitive Times. And in theſe things, let them undergo a ſtrict Tryal and Examination; and if they be not found compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently inſtructed in them, let them be rejected. Let it not be thought a ſufficient Qualification, to have ſeen a Univerſity, and ſpent ſome little time there. Let enquiry be made, what Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60562:34"/>they have made, what Learning they have obtained by the time they have ſpent there. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may come as arrant Fools, and Ignorants, from thence, as they went thither, and ſometimes much more. If no place in the Miniſtry, nor Preferment in the Church were to be obtained without Learning, it would oblige young Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to follow their Studies, and imploy their Time in the proſecution of neceſſary Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the Miniſterial Office, that they might be capable of it: But where little elſe is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in order thereunto, but Submiſſion to the Eccleſiaſtical Yoke, and a good wide Throat that can ſwallow a <hi>Pompion,</hi> 'tis no wonder if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe be Learnt or Laboured after by a great many.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Let greater care likewiſe be taken of the Piety and Sobriety of their Converſations. <hi>Ad Perſonarum quidem delectum quod attinet, qui ad munus ejuſmodi publicum eligi debent, tales eſſe oportet ut duo iſta in iis inveniantur, Primò, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrina ſana &amp; orthodoxa, Deinde vita &amp; mores convenientes non modo profeſſioni Religionis Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianae, verum etiam tam ſancto &amp; ſingulari mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neri.

Let none be admitted to the Sacred Office, that are of Impious Lives, and Immoral Converſations; ſuch perſons give occaſion to men of Prophane and Atheiſtical Tempers and Inclinations, to ſcoff, ſcorn, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60562:35"/>deride all Religion, and burleſque it out of the World: and to others that are of pious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Inclinations, to forſake Publick Aſſemblies, and run after Private Meetings, and Conventicles. Theſe things are obvious, and no man that hath Eyes in his head, can very well miſs the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of them. And thus 'twill be, till greater care be taken of the Lives and Practices of thoſe that are admitted to miniſter in holy things; of which at preſent I ſee no great I kelihood, ſeeing thoſe that make the fierceſt Declamations againſt Separation &amp; Conventicles, &amp; do ſometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain alſo of the Atheiſm, Prophaneneſs, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery of the Times, take no care of removing away the Cauſes, and Occaſions of them. For I do not doubt but that very much of the Impiety, Irreligion, Separation and Diviſion, which do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound among us, is in a great degree imputable to the Ignorance and Wickedneſs of Clergy-men. Were Clergy-men perſons of Wiſdom, Learning and Gravity, and of unblemiſhed Converſation, that had nothing to do with any of the unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Works of Darkneſs themſelves, they would ſhame and rebuke the Licentiouſneſs of the Age, and more eaſily draw people from the Private Aſſemblies to the more Publick Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p n="11">11. If the Governours of the Church ſhall think fit to Commend a Chriſtian Inſtitution, or Form of Doctrine to the Clergy, for the Direction of their Sermons, and Publick Diſcourſes, I know no hurt in it, it may have its Advantages and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60562:35"/>Utilities; but the <hi>Impoſing</hi> ſuch a thing is to me an Averſion. I know not what to compare it to better, than a Rack, where mens Joynts &amp; Limbs are retched and extended to their very great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and vexation. To Impote a large Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, containing many and uncertain Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſuch as have exerciſed the Wits of Learned men for many Ages, and are like to do ſo to the Worlds end, is to ſet mens Minds upon the Tenters, and to exerciſe an inſupportable Tyranny over their Judgments and Conſciences, to the breaking of the Peace of Chriſtians, and the Ruine of multitudes of good, and pious, and holy men, and this to the great detriment of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the Souls of men, and the Joy of the Devil and his Angels. And I do proteſt, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but wonder, by what fate even ſome good and excellent men are engaged in favour of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; Is it not as evident as that the Sun ſhines at Noon, that they have Rent, and Torn, and Divided the Churches of God in all Ages for theſe 1300 years, and have engaged them in thoſe Heats and Animoſities againſt each other, that by mutual Cenſures and Excommunications they cenſure the whole Univerſe of Chriſtians unto Hell? I doubt not but that God will be more kind to them all, then they are to each other, or elſe I know not what will become of them, and where their Portion muſt fall. But this is one of the happy Effects of Impoſitions, which I can hardly mention without Indignation, and yet ſome
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60562:36"/>good men ſeem to be mightly in Love with it, and hug and embrace it as an excellent Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Union and Peace. <hi>Je demande que nous diſtinguions ſoigneuſement entre le's Doctrines ſi clairement eſtabilies en la parole de Dieu, que tous les Chreſtiennes ſont obliges de les rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voir; &amp; celles qui ont beſoin, pour leur eclairciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſement, du travail &amp; de la Meditation des hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes pour les eclaircir; que nous n'en admettions point d'autres que les premiers pour fondamentales &amp; invariables; &amp; que quant aux autres nous puiſſons nous diſpenſer de les recevoir ſans prejudice du ſalut, qui ne doit dependre que des premiers.

               <p n="12">12. Many things may be forbidden by our Governours to the Clergy, which they ought not to oblige them to abjure or renounce. Suppoſe a Clergy-man ſhould have entertained an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that Ordination by Presbyters is lawful and valid, and that a Particular or Parochial Church is endowed with all Power, that Chriſt Jeſus hath given to his Church: Peradventure our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours may without any hurt or injury to him, or any other elſe, forbid him the publiſhing of theſe Opinions, or making Proſelites to them; but why he ſhould be obliged to renounce them, I do not underſtand. He may be a good man, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſerving God in the Goſpel of his Son, though he ſhould be of that perſuaſion in thoſe things; and though he cannot renounce them, he may be very willing to ſilence, and keep ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret his Sentiments, in obedience to his Superiors, and for the ſake of Peace. Again, to the like purpoſe Submiſſion to many things may be more ſafely required, than approbation; and there are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of pious and peaceable men, that could endure and bear with many things that they can never approve. Many men peradventure might endure the uſe of the Croſs in Baptiſm, and the denial of the Sacrament to ſuch as refuſe to take it kneeling, and the ſinging of Prayers in an unintelligible tone, and many other things which they would never like nor approve. And indeed ſuch is the World, and ſuch is the Church, that many things muſt be endured, which cannot,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60562:37"/>nor ought not to be approved, for neither the one, nor the other, will ever be ſo good as they ſhould be. And here do I like well that good tempered Rule of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and which indeed is alwaies reaſonable, <hi>Adhibendus eſt modus tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raque ſervanda, nec in confirmatione virtutis neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligenda eſt diſciplinae ſeveritas, nec immoderatione coercionis dirumpendum vinculum ſocietatis.</hi> Cont.

               <p n="13">13. If Silence and Submiſſion had been requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, where Abjuration and Approbation hath been Impoſed, the Chriſtian World had known more Peace, and Religion had flouriſhed, and been much more ſucceſsful, than it hath been for many hundred years. Silence and Submiſſion would have obtained all thoſe ends, which have been ſought for in vain, by peremptory and rigorous Impoſitions. But when ſome men are not ſatisfied that others do quietly bear and ſubmit to their Pride, their Domination and imperious Folly, but they muſt alſo approve it, juſtifie it. &amp; commend it. This is ſo monſtrous a piece of Tyranny, that I know not to whom originally to impute it, unleſs to the Devil, who requires the ſame of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; but thoſe that are the Freemen of Chriſt, can never endure it. Nay, I will add this little on the contrary hand, That had ſome things been condemned only to <hi>Silence,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation,</hi> and others been required only as to <hi>Submiſſion,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Approbation,</hi> I do believe we ſhould have never ſeen thoſe Diviſions, nor known

But there are ſome Clergy-men in this, and ſome in another World, that were of another mind, though it is like they have by this changed their Opinion at leaſt ſome of them, and others will do it in due time. <hi>Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiones Diviſiones pariunt, &amp; quo plures fuerint deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiones, eo plures inde oriuntur Diviſiones &amp; Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata.</hi> Curcellaeus ubi ſupra.</p>
               <p n="14">14. If Hereticks in Fundamentals, and Perſons of pernicious and dangerous Opinions, creep into the Church, let them after due Admonition, by their Superiours and Collegues, be rejected. This is the Method that the Apoſtle preſcribes, and I know not where to find a better. Impoſitions to obviate Hereticks, have kept many ſober and uſeful men out of the Church, but in my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion very few Hereticks. They are uſually men of a lubricous and ſlippery ingeny, and 'tis a very hard matter to ſet any traps or gins, which they will not eſcape, or to make any nooſes, out of which they will not ſlip their necks; and I am abundantly convinced, that where <hi>One</hi> Heretick, or dangerouſly Erroneous perſon, <hi>Many</hi> excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Learned and Pious Perſons that might have been very uſeful Inſtruments in the Church of God, have been excluded by this means. There is care ought to be taken to prevent Ignorant and Scandalous Perſons, from entring into the Church
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60562:38"/>or Miniſtry; yet that hinders not but that ſome ſuch Varlets do intrude into it. I think now that the ſame Methods of proceeding, which are uſed againſt wicked and immoral men, are to be uſed againſt men of unſound and dangerons Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. The Governours of our Church do not think fit to Impoſe Laws and Rules of ſevereſt Temperance, Sobriety, Juſtice upon all ſuch as are admitted into the Sacred Office, and I know no reaſon why they ſhould preſcribe ſtricter Rules to their Judgments than they do to their Lives; and that as a wicked Converſation becomes penal and liable to cenſure, when it diſcovers it ſelf; ſo 'tis time enough to puniſh Erroneous Perſons when their Errours do appear; for theſe entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Impoſitions (which are a ſort or kind of preventing Medicines,) do, as I muſt ſay ſtill, rather choak honeſt men, than bar the Hereticks, or perſons of dangerous and miſchievous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>No particular Church ought with rigour to require Subſcriptions to Articles that are evidently true and neceſſary to be profeſſed; becauſe in the Diviſion of hearts that is in the World, it is certain that ſome good men may diſſent, and then either they ſhall be afflicted, or tempted to Hypocriſie: Of either of which if Eccleſiaſtical Laws be guilty, they are not for Edification; they are neither juſt, nor pious, and therefore oblige not. Biſhop</hi> Taylor, Duc. dubitantium, lib. 3. pag. 358.</p>
               <p n="15">15. If the Biſhops of the Church did vigilant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſpect both the Lives and Doctrine of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60562:38"/>Clergy, I do not ſee any great danger conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to the Intruſion of ſome ill, and Erroneous Perſons into the Sacred Function; for as ſoon as their Prophaneneſs and Errours are manifeſt, they are liable to Admonition and Cenſure, and if they remain obſtinate and incorrigible, they may be ſuſpended, and removed from the Miniſterial Office. This I do confeſs requires great Care and Intendance over the Inferiour Clergy, which yet I think no more than is the duty of thoſe that are the Overſeers of God's Houſe, and do or ſhould watch for Souls. But alas! that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which attends the Epiſcopal Office, ſhould be one thing, and the Labour that is annexed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it another; that the former ſhould be loved ſo much by ſome men in the World, who have no extraordinary kindneſs, if any at all, for the latter. Perſonally to inſpect and ſuperintend the Doctrine and Manners of the Clergy is a drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that theſe cannot bear, and muſt be done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by Commiſſaries and Officials, and Arch-Deacons, who think nothing penal, or worthy of rebuke in them, unleſs it be ſome defection in Conformity, nor nothing worthy of praiſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be the virtue of Canonical Obedience.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Perſonal Inſpection into the Lives and Doctrines of the Inferiour Clergy, is indeed a thing unpracticable in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whilſt Dioceſſes are of the preſent Latitude and Extenſions.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60562:39"/>the Lives and Doctrines of the Inferiour Miniſters and People can never be reconciled with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Extent of Dioceſſes, it were to be wiſhed in the next place, that Biſhops and Suffragans were multiplied and encreaſed to that number, as they might be capable of performing all the Duties of the Epiſcopal Office, and this I think might be done if our Superiours pleaſed, without altering the preſent Conſtitution, or diminiſhing the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues or juſt Honour of the preſent Biſhops and Epiſcopal Sees. For Example hereunto, St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> is noted, who ſent a Biſhop to <hi>Fuſſala,</hi> only becauſe it was at too great a diſtance for his Care.

Let the Biſhops take heed, who though they find <hi>Vicarios in Officiis,</hi> ſhall find none <hi>in Tormentis</hi> (according to <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and him) if they neglect their Charge. This mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of <hi>Overſeers</hi> would advance very much the Reputation of the Prieſthood; for if they were diligently watched, it would preſerve and encreaſe <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Sobriety</hi> among them, which are the things that muſt give them a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. 'Tis not a diſtinctive habit, nor Titles of Honour, nor the Countenance of Authority and Laws, that will procure them an Eſteem and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, but 'tis great Knowledge and Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Judgment, great Piety, Mortification, Self-denial, Contempt of the World, Love to God and Men, Compaſſion towards Souls, and Zeal
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60562:40"/>for the Salvation of Sinners, that muſt make them loved and eſteemed in the World. And theſe things would be mightily promoted, aſſiſted, and encouraged by the Superintendence, and Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Inſpection, Care and Example of Good and Excellent Biſhops.</p>
               <p n="18">18. As the Perſonal Inſpection of Biſhops would advance the Reputation of the Clergy, by promoting Knowledge, Wiſdom, and Sobriety among them; ſo the Wiſdom, Good Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Eſteem of the Clergy, would mightily advance and encreaſe Piety, Virtue and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs among the Laity. There's nothing that I know of, unleſs it be the Influence and Aſſiſtances of the Divine Grace, that contributes more to the making of men good, than the Wiſdom and Piety of thoſe that Preach the Goſpel.

If things of dark and uncertain nature be mingled in our Publick Offices and Prayers, they will occaſion the ſame Diviſions, and Separations, the ſame Factions and Schiſms, as if they had been put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Publick Teſt and Symbol of Communion; and thoſe perſons that come into the Church at one door, will be ſhut out at the other, and what is given to them with the right hand, will be taken away with the left. Let the matter of of Publick and Common-Prayers, be plain and indiſputable; let them contain nothing that can reaſonably be ſcrupled; let the Confeſſions, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, and Thankſgivings that do compound them, be ſuch as all Good Men may conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and readily and heartily ſay <hi>Amen.</hi> I muſt adde; Let them be expreſſed in the Language and Words of Scripture, this will make them the more grateful and ſavoury to Pious and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Minds; this will render them the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable to all men; and certainly no words can be more proper to expreſs our Requeſts and Deſires to God withal, than thoſe that have the Holy Ghoſt for their Author. A Propoſal of this nature was made to ſome Biſhops ſuddenly upon
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60562:41"/>His Majeſties Reſtauration, but 'twas rejected. A Lyturgy ſo formed and expreſſed, would not ſerve their Ends, nor promote their Purpoſes ſo effectually, as that which had been formerly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and in uſe, and therefore in defiance to all Peace and Union, <hi>That</hi> muſt be Re-eſtabliſhed. 'Tis true, there are not many things exception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able therein, but ſomething had been long object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt ſome paſſages in it, and the whole had been ſeveral years diſuſed in almoſt all Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations; and if from thence occaſion had been taken, to new Caſt and Mould it, I do humbly conceive it might have promoted more Love and Union, more Charity and Peace, than the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it, as we have done with almoſt no Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. I remember a paſſage in <hi>Cyprian, De Oratione Dominica, When Chriſt hath told us</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that whatſoever we ask the Father in his Name, he will give it us.

I do confeſs that I never read or heard any thing ſaid or written againſt Forms of Prayer, that would convince me of the unlawfulneſs of them; nevertheleſs, becauſe there are many Learned, Pious, and Good Men, of other thoughts and apprehenſions, I do heartily wiſh that they might be permitted the Liberty of their Judgments and Conſciences in that Caſe; nor am I able to ſee any danger, miſchief, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience conſequent thereunto. There were greater Differences and Varieties among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Churches (without any breach of Love or Charity) than the uſe of a Form or Extemporate Conceptions do amount unto; and ſo it might be ſtill, if Chriſtians, both Clergy and Laity, were as meek, humble, and peaceable as then they were, and as great Enemies to Pride, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and Domination, as then they ſeemed to be.</p>

If the matter of this Objection be granted, I know not what prejudice it is to the Allegations produced from him; for though he were a <hi>Novatian,</hi> I hope he might ſpeak Truth, and that the Credit of his Hiſtory is not blaſted by that ſuppoſition; nor could he be ſo utterly bereft of all Senſe, as to report ſuch things, wherein 'twere eaſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute him, if they had been falſe.

               <p>But 'tis objected, that thoſe that uſe that way of Praying, do many times ſpeak Nonſenſe, and blaſpheme in their Addreſſes and Supplications to God Almighty, to which I have theſe few things to ſay, 1. I believe thoſe that make this report of mens Extemporate Conceptions, do not ſpeak upon their own knowledge, (they having little or no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with ſuch, as make uſe of them) and thoſe that are their Informers, peradventure may be none of the moſt upright, juſt and impartial men, but may put an ill ſenſe upon words that are very innocent, and of ſound and ſafe ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. 2. Let this Objection be acknowledged true, what can reaſonably be inferred from it?
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60562:44"/>Is it unlawful to be uſed, becauſe ſome men have not skill enough to perform it? Will not the ſame Argument hold againſt Preaching? And may it not with as much reaſon be ſaid, ſome men Preach Nonſenſe, Falſe Doctrine, Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; others Preach fooliſhly, and pedantickly, not to the Edification, but to the Amazement of their Congregations, and therefore Preaching is unlawful. If this Method of Argumentation be good in one caſe, 'tis good in both; but I am of Opinion, 'tis good in neither; and that the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way of Arguing from thoſe miſcarriages is thus. Some men are neither able to Pray ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporately in a decorous manner, nor to Preach ſoundly, and to the Edification of their hearers, therefore they muſt let it alone, till they be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſtructed in the one and in the other: Or in Prayer, let them uſe a Form (which I do not doubt is lawful) and in their Sermons let them take aſſiſtance from Books, whoſe Authors were better skill'd in the Art of Preaching than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but in the mean time let them not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thoſe, that need not theſe Helps and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances, but can Pray and Preach in comely, grave, and profitable manner, out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their own hearts.</p>
               <p>Another Objection as wiſe as the former, is this: In Extemporate Prayers men ſet their hands to a blank, and ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to they know not what; they give the ſame blind Aſſent to the Prayers of every Prieſt, or Extemporizer, that the Papiſts
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60562:44"/>do in things doctrinal to the Authority of the Church. This very ſilly Objection hath been inſiſted on, &amp; urged, againſt Extemporate Prayers, by ſome very great men: To which I reply. 1. If men ſaid <hi>Amen</hi> to Petitions before they heard them, or before He that Prayes had expreſſed himſelf in words concerning them, there might be ſomething of ſenſe and truth in it; but Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to Petitions before they are made, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, is a thing that I underſtand not, nor thoſe, I believe, that have Communion in thoſe kind of Prayers; and if Perſons do not give their Aſſent till the Petition be formed, or expreſſed by words, I hope they may deny their Aſſent, if they judge the matter of it unlawful. 2. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Doctrine, no man can joyn with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Prayer ſafely, unleſs he know aforehand what is the Matter and Contents of it; and thus we muſt have Forms of Prayer for all occaſions and emergencies (if it were poſſible to hit of them) as well as for ordinary Caſes, or elſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may ſet their hands to a blank, and ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to they know not what. We muſt have an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Form of Bleſſing before Meat, and of Thankſgiving after it, or Form of Prayer for all Maſters of Families, Tutors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which muſt be alwaies uſed, and no other Form; a Notion that ſome of thoſe that are in <hi>Bedlam</hi> may poſſibly believe, but it would be ſtrange that any that are out of that place ſhould believe it, unleſs ſome few that ought to be ſent thither. 3. The expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60562:45"/>of multitudes of good and pious People, doth confute this Objection every day. They are ſure they do joyn heartily in Extemporate Prayers, and that they do not ſet their hands to a blank, or ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to they know not what. They know that they Aſſent not to Petitions before they be expreſſed, and that they do Diſſent where they do not approve them, though 'tis very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that they have occaſion for it; For who are thoſe perſons that expreſs themſelves in words ſinful, blaſphemous, and without ſenſe, they do not know. But enough of this; and peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſome may think I have ſaid too much, to take notice only of ſuch a brainleſs Objection.</p>
               <p>This is ſufficient to my purpoſe, that Diſſent from a Publick Lyturgy, and the Uſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Prayers, are no Reaſons for making Churches or Perſons Schiſmatical. If any things of this nature are enough to denominate ſingle Perſons or Societies of Men Schiſmatical, 'tis in the Power of thoſe that are uppermoſt to make whom they pleaſe Schiſmaticks. Perſons and Churches may walk in all the Statutes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Lord blameleſs, and yet be cut off from the Church of God as Schiſmatical and conſequently be excluded Life Eternal; for 'tis affirmed of late, that whoever is cut off from a particular True Church, is cut off from the Church Univerſal, out of which there is no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and ſo, for ought that I can ſee, a Man, or a Society of Men may be very good Chriſtians,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60562:45"/>and yet ſhut out of the Kingdom of Heaven. Which I ſhall be very ready to believe when I can think the Surface of the <hi>Moon</hi> to be no broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than a Sieve, or the Body of the <hi>Sun</hi> no bigger than the Globe that <hi>Atlas</hi> bears upon his ſhoulders in <hi>Cornhill. Ce ſeroit un grand bien que les fideles fuſſent ſi purfait, ment d'accord qu'il n'y euſt ent'reux qu'un ſeul ſentiment ſur toutes les choſes de la religion: Mais ce bon heur eſtant pluſteſt a ſouhaitter, qu' a eſperer pour l'infirmité de noſtre intelligence tamdis que nous voyageons en la terre, l'Apoſtre nous ordonne de nous retiner &amp; moderer, en telle ſorti qu'il ſi rencoutre de la di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſité dans noſtre concord.</hi> Daillé <hi>ubi ſupra.</hi>

               <p>TO proceed therefore to three or four things more I have to propoſe, and are yet behind. The one of them, that is, the One and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth, is, Let not theſe Tolerated Churches be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Schiſmaticks, but let them have the ſame Eſtimation that the Churches of the Jewiſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion had from thoſe that were of the Gentile Communion, ſome Diverſity in Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies there was between theſe Churches then, but they did not repute each other as Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; they accounted each other True Churches notwithſtanding that Diverſity of Opinion and Practices that were among them, and ſo for ought I can ſee, might we alſo. Is it reaſonable or juſt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60562:46"/>to deny thoſe to be true Men, that do differ in the Manner of their Dreſs, and in the Colour or Faſhion of their Garments? Or can it be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with Truth, that the <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>America</hi> are not of the ſame Humane Race with us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they go almoſt naked, and we cover, and dreſs, and adorn our ſelves with all the fine things that Nature and Art can furniſh us withal? In ſome parts of <hi>Perſia</hi> (as <hi>Herbert</hi> reports in his Travels) they expoſe their Dead, in others they burn them, and we bury them. The <hi>Eſſedons</hi> among the <hi>Scythians</hi> mince their Dead Friends with the Fleſh of Beaſts, and eat them. <hi>Morendo il padre ad alcuno, tutti i ſuoi parenti portano ivi piu pecore, &amp; amuzzetele &amp; fattele in pezzi, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuzzano ancho il morte padre de colui, che gli ha invitate, e meſcolate tutte le carni inſieme, mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giano di compagnia, e ſcorticata e nettata la teſta del morto la indorano e ſe ne ſerveno per un ſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacro al quale agni anno fanno maggiori ceremonie, &amp; amazzano maggior vittime,</hi> as the <hi>Italian Giovanni Boemo</hi> has it, in his Book of the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of Nations.</hi> The differing Manners of People are reconcilable with the ſame Common Nature. And if theſe be true Men, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe things in which they differ from us, ſo may theſe that I have ſpoken of be true Churches, notwithſtanding they may differ in ſome things from thoſe that have the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Favour and Eſtabliſhment of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the Law.</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:60562:46"/>
               <p>Another of them, that is, the Two &amp; twentieth, is, Let it not be thought a Scandal or Reproach for the People of ſeveral Communions, ſometimes to communicate (in ſuch parts of Worſhip as they can) with each other. Why ſhould it be thought an infamous thing for a Church-man to go to a Separate Meeting, and hear their Sermons, and partake with them in their Prayers? Do they not Preach the ſame Doctrine, and offer up the ſame Petitions, (though not in the ſame words) that is Diſcourſed, and are ſent up to the Throne of Grace, in the Publick and Allowed Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies and Congregations? And why ſhould not the Tolerated and Diſſenting part of Chriſtians come ſometimes and hear the Diſcourſes and Prayers of the Eſtabliſhed Miniſtry? Do they not Preach the ſame Jeſus, the ſame Faith, the ſame Repentance, and the ſame Obedience to the Laws of the Goſpel? Will not many of both Parties Live together hereafter in the ſame Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Will they not behold the Face of the ſame God and his Chriſt? and joyn together in the ſame Prayers and Hallelujahs, in the ſame Quires of Saints and Angels for ever more? And ſhall Chriſtians that will live together for ever in the World to come, live at that Diſtance and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in this, that they will not ſo much as own each other, nor communicate in the Service of their common Lord and Maſter? Surely this is not well, there is fault ſomewhere, and I am afraid that neither Party is Innocent. This
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60562:47"/>ſtrangeneſs and diſtance is not ſeemingly in Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; thoſe that have the ſame God for their Maker, and the ſame Jeſus for their Redeemer, and the ſame holy Spirit for their Sanctifier thoſe that are begotten by the ſame Word, to the ſame Eternal Hope of Glory, ſhould not live like A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liens and Strangers, much leſs like Enemies to each other: They ſhould have a mutual dearneſs and tenderneſs for each other, and communicate together in what they can, notwithſtanding their differences in ſome, yea in many ſmaller things. To advance yet one ſtep more, Let it not be thought a crime, for a Publick Miniſter to Preach in a Separate Aſſembly, nor for a Tolerated Preacher to do the like Office in a Publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; I know no hurt in ſuch a mutual En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchange of Love and Duty to and for each other: But I am very much aſſured, much good would be conſequent unto it. It would beget and encreaſe Love and Kindneſs; it would take off thoſe Prejudices, and Falſe Apprehenſions that through Ignorance and Strangeneſs men of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Judgments have entertained of each other. I do not at all doubt, but that there are multitudes of perſons of contrary Judgments in ſome things, that would love each other with great Dearneſs, were they intimately acquainted and known to each other. Yea I will add, that ſuch a friendly correſpondence and entercourſe of Kindneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Conformiſt and Nonconformiſt, would do more to Heal the Breaches, and Unite the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60562:47"/>Judgments and Practices of the Differing Parties, than many Impoſitions, ſharp and ſevere Laws and Executions. Men are to be drawn by Love and Kindneſs, by Charms and Attractives to Union and Conformity, not to be driven to it with Beetles and Sledges, with Swords and Axes.</p>
               <p>The Three and twentieth is, In this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of Love and Duty, let nothing be Preached, but thoſe common Truths in which both Parties are agreed. Let them not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to meddle with thoſe Doctrines which are the Subject and Matter of Controverſie between them. This will not generate Love, or ſerve any good end that I know on, but will enkindle Wrath, and make Animoſities and Feuds, and ſet thoſe that differ at an irreconcilable diſtance from each other. There are things enough in which they agree to furniſh matter for their Diſcourſes of this kind: And to come into each others Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, to rail upon each others Perſons and Opinions, is rude and inſufferable. It is very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Advice bere of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Author. <hi>Eſtu dia de ſuffrir con paciencia quales quier defectos y fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quezas agenas, mirando que tu tienes mucho que te ſufran los otros. Si non puedes hazer a ti qual deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeas, como quieres tener al otros a tu ſabor? Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently endeavour to bear the Imperfections and Weakneſſes of others, conſidering that there is much in you that others muſt bear and endure. If you cannot make your ſelves ſuch as you would be, how can you expect that others ſhould be according
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60562:48"/>to your liſt,</hi> or as you would have them? Neither are the Preachers of both ſides to rail at, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach each other in their own proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Churches and Congregations, or in their Printed Books and Pamphlets. If they do think fit to meddle with each others peculiar Opinions, let them do it with calmneſs and meekneſs; let them in fair language, confute one anothers Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, without all unneceſſary Reflections, or perſonal Provocations. Reproaches, and Mutual Expoſing of each other to common ſcorn does no good. No man ever becomes a Convert in his Judgment by being railed on, expoſed, or derided. This Method of proceeding enkindles and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages mens Spirits; it heals no Wounds, nor makes up any Breaches, but makes them greater, and more uncapable of Cure. <hi>No ay ninguno ſin defecto ninguno ſin carga, ninguno es ſufficiente para ſi, nin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guno es, complidamente ſabio para ſi, y portanto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viene llevarnos unos a utros. No man is without defect, no man without fault, none is ſufficient for himſelf, and therefore we muſt bear and tolerate each other.</hi> Menos precio <hi>del Mundo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is ſaid in theſe laſt Directions in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half and favour of an interchangeable Love, and Offices of Kindneſs, betwixt Approved and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated Miniſters and Churches, is no more than what <hi>Amyraldus</hi> pleads for betwixt the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and the Churches of thoſe Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Having ſpoken of the great diſtance and prejudices of thoſe two Parties againſt each other
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60562:48"/>he adds, <hi>Nunc in magnam ſpem venimus fore ut in poſterum tempus omnino melius ſe res habeant. Nam producere quidem in ſuggeſtum Auguſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, reformatae confeſſionis Miniſtrum, qui in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperie aliqua animi, vel Dogma Calvinianum in iis in quibus diſſentimus ad populum ſpargeret, vel in Dogma Lutheranum inveheretur, uti pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterum eſſet atque temerarium: ſic etiam in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mula Concordiae injuſtum pronunciari debet, quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admodum Auguſtanae confeſſionis preconem, apud reformatos vel detonare in Calvinum, vel eas res quas probare non poſſumus, magna vi perſuadere velle, nemo eſt qui non judicet minime ferendum eſſe, quique id non pariter prohibendum arbitretur.

               </p>
               <p>The Difference between the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> and <hi>Lutherans,</hi> is as great, and in ſome things greater than betwixt the Churches of Publick Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thoſe that I do wiſh might be tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among us; and why there might not be the ſame interchanges of Love, Familiarity and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs betwixt them, as this Learned and Pious Pacificator wiſhes and deſires, yea hopes might be amongſt the <hi>Auguſtans</hi> and <hi>Reformed,</hi> I can ſee no reaſon. What reaſon might be given why a Conformiſt might not hear Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bates,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> at <hi>Pinners-Hall,</hi> or elſwhere? yea or why he might not Preach there himſelf? What reaſon can be given why theſe worthy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent men might not be permitted to Preach at <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> Chappel, <hi>Bow,</hi> or other Churches in the City? Is not their Doctrine as ſound, their Miniſterial Qualifications as great, and their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Preaching as likely to do good, at leaſt as ſome of the Conformable Clergy? I am not ignorant what Objections the Intereſt, Paſſions, and Prejudices of men, do make againſt what I have propoſed and diſcourſed, nor ſhall I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to anſwer them. Humble, holy, mortified men, that love Peace, and the Souls of men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their own petty Intereſts and Advantages, can eaſily anſwer them themſelves, and others will not be convinced by any thing that I ſhall reply unto them. There's no confuting the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60562:49"/>that are made by Pride, Covetouſneſs, Ambition, Love of Empire and Dominion, and other Paſſions of Infernal Race; and I have no preſent Inclination to ſpend any Words upon the Objections of inconfutable Men. It is true, that what I propoſe may ſeem at preſent unpracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, by reaſon of the Inconſiſtency of ſuch Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes with the Eſtabliſhed Laws: But it is not impoſſible, I hope, that His Majeſty (who is the Breath of our Noſtrils) with His <hi>Parliament,</hi> may come to think fit, that ſuch Laws be relaxed for the Uniting and Strengthening the <hi>Proteſtant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Enemy. And if it ſhould pleaſe <hi>God</hi> to incline the Heart of the <hi>King,</hi> and His <hi>Great Council</hi> ſo to do; then will that which I have ſaid be not only very practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but, as I think, very uſeful; that is, to leſſen and abate Differences, reſtore decayed and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love, and to bring <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to a greater U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity in Judgment and Practice, than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Means or Endeavors whatſoever. <hi>Redintigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem amicitiae neceſſario ſequi debet officiorum ſedula communicatio at<expan>

               <p>The <hi>Laſt Propoſal</hi> I have to offer, that is the <hi>Twenty-Fourth</hi> and chiefeſt, &amp; therefore reſerved to the laſt, is this: Let theſe <hi>Tolerated Churches</hi> be made, and then reputed Parts of the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church, whereof the <hi>King</hi> is the Head. What other Head to find for it, under that Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after all that hath of late been ſaid concerning it, I am as yet to ſeek. If the <hi>Biſhops</hi> be made
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60562:50"/>the Head of the National-Church, by the ſame Reaſon all the Biſhops of the Chriſtian World muſt be the Head of the Univerſal Church; (and indeed, thoſe that affirm the One, affirm the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) which ſome Men will ſay, is <hi>French Popery;</hi> and I know not how to confute them. If the Arch-Biſhops be the Head of the Church, it will be enquired, whether they claim their Title <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> or <hi>Humano?</hi> If <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> they muſt prove it, which will not eaſily be done: If <hi>Jure Humano,</hi> I hope they will grant the <hi>King</hi> Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to them, and that they are but His Officers and Delegates; which is the ſame thing that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and which is agreeable to the Opinion of our Firſt Reformers, as is apparent in Dr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>'s <hi>Hiſtory of the Reformation:</hi> For <hi>Cranmer</hi> took a Commiſſion from K. <hi>Edward,</hi> by which he held his Biſhoprick, and exerciſed his Juriſdiction. <hi>Vid.

And this is the ſame thing, that hath been lately propoſed by that <hi>Thoughtful</hi> Man, Mr. <hi>Humfrey,</hi> in the End of a Diſcourſe written by Himſelf and Others, and dedicated to the Right Honourable, the Earl of <hi>Hallifax,</hi> that great and ſagacious Stateſman. I know ſome Men are <hi>Deaf Adders,</hi> who will not be brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it, let a Man have <hi>Charmed never ſo wiſely;</hi> but Theſe (I take it) are ſuch only, who are Enemies to Peace, and will part with nothing for the ſake of it.</p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:60562:50"/>
               <p>And why now theſe <hi>Tolerated Churches</hi> ſhould not be accounted true <hi>Churches,</hi> and Parts of the National-Church, whereof the <hi>King</hi> is the Head, I do not imagine. In my Apprehenſion, they look very like the Churches we read of in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> which (no Man doubts) were of <hi>Divine Appointment.</hi> For although I do not know, but that ſome particular Perſons from among the Clergy, fitteſt for it, (As St. <hi>Paul</hi> chiefly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed himſelf in Preaching the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and meddled but little with <hi>Baptiſm</hi>) may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and prudently choſen, and employed chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Government of ſeveral Congregations, even as many as they can perſonally know, and be acquainted withal; and if they be called Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and have a peculiar Conſecration, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be done in Ordination, Cenſures, and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, but with their Knowledge, Direction, and Approbation, I would have no Controverſie with them about it: Yet I do profeſſedly avow, that I can find no ſuch thing in the Scripture, nor in the Practice of the Church for 200 Years. I know 'tis ſaid, That the Apoſtles were Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans, and that they governed all or moſt of the Chriſtian Churches whil'ſt they lived; but I ſee no Proof of it, and there's one Argument againſt it, which I cannot tell how to anſwer, and 'tis this. If the Chriſtian Churches, in the Apoſtles days, had no Governours but themſelves, 'tis certain, that for the moſt part they had none at all, for they never fixed in any place, but having
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60562:51"/>preached the Goſpel, planted Churches, and ſettled Officers amongſt them, they left them, and went to other Places and Countreys. 'Tis true, they did ſometimes return, and viſit the Churches that they planted; but who Governed them in the intermediate Periods of Time? Or were there no Ordinations, Cenſures, or Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions performed in them, or none but by their Direction and Command? That ſome Acts of Diſcipline were performed by their Direction and Command, I do acknowledge; but that all were ſo, and that none ought to be performed without it, I ſee no reaſon to believe.</p>
               <p>Touching the Practice of the Church after the Apoſtles, till the end of the Second Century, I muſt ſay, That I can find no Evidence of Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Epiſcopacy, or of any Churches bigger than ſome ſingle Congregations among us at this day. I think the Churches of <hi>Corinth, Epheſus, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> &amp;c. ſingle Congregations, and that they all Communicated at one Altar; and that there are many Congregations in <hi>England</hi> as numerous, and ſome much more numerous than they. Yea, I will add (after all that hath been ſaid of late to the contrary) that I am not convinced, that the Church of <hi>Carthage</hi> in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s days, which was Two hundred and fifty Years after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was any bigger than ſome of our Parochial-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. In an Epiſtle to the Clergy of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> he tells them, <hi>That from the beginning of his Epiſcopacy, he determined to do nothing by his own
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60562:51"/>private Judgment, nor without their Counſel, and the Conſent of his People. A primordio Epiſcopatus mei ſtatuerim, nihil ſine Conſilio Veſtro, &amp; ſine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſu Plebis meae, privata ſententia gerere.</hi> Ep. 6. ex Edit. Goulartii.</p>
               <p>What doth St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> mean by <hi>His People,</hi> in theſe words? Doth he mean the whole, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Part of a Dioceſs, in the Modern ſenſe of the Word? Did he aſſemble his Dioceſs, and take their Conſent in all things that did concern them? <hi>Credat Judaeus Appella.</hi> Many Paſſages of like nature might be produced from this great Saint and Martyr, and are by Learned Men, which I will not repeat.</p>
               <p>And for ought that I can perceive, <hi>Dioceſan E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy</hi> was unknown in this Nation, for ſeveral hundreds of Years after <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> The <hi>Culdees</hi> were the great Preachers of the Goſpel, and Promoters of Chriſtianity in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Thoſe <hi>Culdees</hi> were no Biſhops, nor had any Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but ſuch as was performed by the <hi>Monk,</hi> or <hi>Abbot</hi> of the <hi>Monaſtery,</hi> in the Iſland <hi>Hii.</hi> This <hi>Monk</hi> (who was himſelf no <hi>Biſhop</hi>) and his <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> gave them their Orders; and from thence came <hi>Aidan</hi> and <hi>Finan</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Biſhops;</hi> but had no other Ordination, than that abovementioned. <hi>Wini</hi> was the firſt Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Biſhop in <hi>Britain,</hi> as <hi>Bede</hi> reports. <hi>Non erat tunc ullus excepto</hi> Wini <hi>in tot a</hi> Britannia <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonice Ordinatus Epiſcopus.</hi> Lib. 3. cap. 28.

               <p>The Prefecture and Juriſdiction of <hi>Biſhops</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> ſeems to me of Humane Inſtitution, and derived partly from the Favour of Princes, and partly from the Uſurpation of the <hi>Pope;</hi> and thus gotten, and obtained, they enjoyed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed it for many Hundreds of Years, even till the days of <hi>Henry the Eighth;</hi> who reaſſuming the Authority that had been granted by former Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and uſurped by the <hi>Pope,</hi> obliged them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg their Juriſdiction, by derivation from Himſelf; and ſubjected them to a <hi>Premunire,</hi> in caſe of refuſal: And of this Opinion thoſe <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſeem to be, that took Commiſſions from K. <hi>Henry the Eighth,</hi> and K. <hi>Edward the Sixth,</hi> for their holding their Biſhopricks, and Exerciſe of their Juriſdiction; as I have ſignified already.</p>

               <p>ALthough it be plain enough from what I have diſcourſed, that I plead the Cauſe of none but <hi>Tolerable Diſſenters,</hi> and am Advocate for no Perſons or Churches that maintain perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Errours, and are impenitent and incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible in them: Yet to prevent all Miſunderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, I do again here ſubjoyn, That I plead not the Cauſe of ſuch as ſubvert the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> in the great Eſſentials of it, which the <hi>Jews, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans, Socinians,</hi> and all other <hi>Infidels</hi> do. I would not have Men permitted to Preach down <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and to Preach up meer <hi>Theiſme,</hi> or the Religion of the Antique or Modern <hi>Heathens;</hi> nor of ſuch as Preach Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and Licentious Prophaneſs. I would not have Men permitted to encourage or juſtify Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence or Rapine, Senſuality or Luſt, Rebellion or Treaſon, or any thing that is plainly Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and condemned by the Light of Nature, as well as the Doctrine of Chriſtianity: And of this kind are many <hi>Popiſh Doctrines,</hi> as is evident to all Men, that have converſed in the Writings of their <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> and ſuch as have the Conduct of Conſcience among them. Particular Inſtances whereof may be ſeen in the <hi>Myſtery of Jeſuitiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuits Morals,</hi> by any Man that hath a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60562:54"/>deſire to be ſatisfied concerning them: Nor of ſuch whoſe Doctrines are inconſiſtent with Civil Government, and Publick Peace; and ſuch is the Doctrine of the <hi>Romaniſts.</hi> A <hi>Papiſt</hi> (if he be true to the Opinions and Decrees of their own <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi>) muſt be a Rebel, and a Traytor, whenſoever his <hi>Holineſs</hi> pleaſes to command it. This hath been ſufficiently proved by many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and is obvious enough to ſuch as read their Books: And if there be any other Sect or Sort of People, that maintain ſuch Doctrines, as do diſturb the Peace of Mankind neceſſarily and truly, (and not occaſionally, and by accident, for ſo the Goſpel doth it) I have nothing to ſay on their behalf.</p>
               <p>But if the Toleration that I have propoſed, and pleaded for, ſhould be thought a Means of increaſing the Separation from the Publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations; I reply; Let care be taken (as I ſaid) that the Clergy, who officiate in them, be Men of Worth, Ability, and good Converſation; that is, ſuch as preach and live Piouſly, and love the Honour of <hi>God,</hi> and the Souls of Men: And let ſome Diſcipline be reſtored to particular Churches under the Inſpection of the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and difference be made between the Precious, and the Vile, by the Exerciſe of it; that none be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted and accounted Chriſtians, and admitted to all the Priviledges of Chriſtians, that know nothing but the Name of Chriſtianity, and live in open Defiance to all the Laws thereof: And
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60562:54"/>if theſe two things were done, there would be no great danger of encreaſing the Separation by Tolerating ſome <hi>Diſſenting Churches;</hi> but on the contrary, I do think that Separate Churches would be drained and emptyed, and in a few Years almoſt quite diſſolved thereby. For in my Obſervation, 'tis the Ignorance and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs of Clergy-Men, and the Corruption and Impurity of Churches, that began and doth continue the Diviſions, and Separations, that have been, and ſtill are among us: Let the Cauſe be removed, and taken away, and the Effect will ceaſe.</p>
               <p>Nay, ſuppoſe ſome ſingle Perſons, few in number, ſhould leave the publick and Allowed Congregations, on occaſion of this Toleration, and joyn themſelves to ſeparate Aſſemblies; What great hurt is there in it, and why ſhould any Publick Preacher be offended at it? What hurt or wrong is it to my Phyſician, if I leave him, and go to another, if he cannot cure me, or I do not like his Methods and Preſcriptions? Hath he any Reaſon to be offended, if another do that which he cannot do? I know the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of my own Pariſh does oftentimes meet ſome or other of his Pariſhoners, going to their Conventicles, when he hath been going to Church, and the like in his and their Return; and yet I never heard that he grew into any Paſſion or Diſpleaſure with them about it, much leſs that he proſecuted them at Law for it: But
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60562:55"/>he hath been heard to ſay, <hi>That if they learned the Way to Heaven at their Private Meetings (as he hoped they did, at leaſt ſome of them), he did, and would rejoyce:</hi> And why others may not do ſo too, I ſee no reaſon, nor underſtand any thing to the contrary. Muſt Men die, if I cannot cure their Diſeaſes? Muſt they periſh, if my Pills and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will not recover them? Muſt Men be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if the publick Preacher cannot perſwade them to Faith and Repentance, or teach them the Way to Heaven? Surely, methinks thoſe that know the Worth of Souls, ſhould rejoyce in their Salvation, whoever be the Means of it.</p>
               <p>I will add, that Intereſt hath ſo powerful and mighty an Influence upon Mens Judgments, that were nothing but things abſolutely <hi>neceſſary to Salvation</hi> impoſed, and a Form of wholſom words commended to thoſe that are admitted to the Publick Congregations, and Preferments of the Church, I am very much inclined to believe, that in a few Years it would be hard to find Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to officiate in ſeparate Congregations: Moſt Men would believe thoſe Doctrines which have publick Approbation, and which make them capable of Livings and Advancements; and others would ſilence their particular Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and make no oppoſition unto them, that they alſo might ſhare in them, and where to find Perſons to miniſter in holy things, at Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Churches, would peradventure be no eaſie thing. And if at His <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Reſtauration
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60562:55"/>ſome few, plain, neceſſary things had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and all the reſt only commended and countenanced, I do believe, that where there is now Ten <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> there would not have been above One. 'Tis theſe numerous and unneceſſary Impoſitions, that are the Plague of the Chriſtian World, as well as the <hi>Church of England;</hi> and have both made and continued all the Breaches, and Separations, that our Ears have heard, and our Eyes have ſeen. <hi>Qui naturam Religionis prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>I have anſwered the grand Cavil, made in favour of Impoſitions, and in prejudice to a brief Creed and Symbol, containing only a few plain neceſſary things, expreſſed in the Language of Scripture, or rather the three Summaries of Religion, contained in the common Creed, Lords Prayer, and Ten Commandments. I have obvia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alſo I think the moſt conſiderable Objections that are uſually made by the Patrons of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. I know what I have ſaid will not pleaſe thoſe kind of Men, and if I had deſigned their Acceptation, I muſt have rayled at Diſſenters, and have repreſented them a Generation of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not worthy to live upon the face of the Earth. I muſt have laid fewel on thoſe flames, that do already rage ſo furiouſly againſt them. But I have other thoughts of thoſe men, and another deſign in theſe papers, who would bring my Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et to quench the Fire, that burns againſt them. I would attempt to abate the rage, and allay the heats that are raiſed, and do threaten their ruine. If what I have written may ſerve this end, I ſhall rejoyce; If it may be acceptable to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and Pious Men, I ſhall not regard the cenſures of thoſe that rage and rave. <hi>Simon Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem

               <p>The Sum of all is this, Peace and Union a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians, is a thing greatly amiable and deſirable; but ſuch are the imperfections, and Corruptions of humane minds, and of ſuch different ſizes and various Prejudices are mens underſtandings, that 'tis morally impoſſible they ſhould agree in more, than ſome plain things. And therefore numerous and unneceſſary Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, are no proper terms of Peace, but great inſtruments of Diviſion, and have been been ſo for many Hundreds of Years. And as much peace as the Church of God is capable of, in this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect State, may be obtained by other and better means; and the Evils that are pretended to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or prevented by impoſing, may be healed and provided for by more Chriſtian Methods. <hi>Ne<expan>

               <p>It is ſome Months ſince this Book (which ſo much concerns that Argument,) was ſent out of the Country, and it was retarded in the Preſs ſeveral Weeks, in hopes of a <hi>Parliament</hi> coming, that might have made the Subject more ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: But now the very Talk of one being lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for this <hi>Summer,</hi> it is fit ſomething be put to it, as may make it to be of uſe in <hi>October.</hi> The <hi>Bees</hi> and <hi>Ants</hi> have their Inſtinct in the Summer, to make Proviſion for their Lives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Winter.</p>
               <p>There are Two ſorts of <hi>Nonconformists</hi> we know; The <hi>One</hi> who do allow of a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and our Parochial Churches, and theſe may be all C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>s: The <hi>Other</hi> who do not allow of either, and theſe muſt be <hi>Indulged,</hi> or deſtroyed. It is two Bills therefore, or theſe two things in one Bill, which are neceſſary to the deſigne of Acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation.</p>
               <p>In that Parliament, the <hi>One</hi> of theſe Bills (for there was <hi>Two</hi> of them, as the <hi>Gentleman</hi> before hath told us) the Bill for <hi>Indulgence,</hi> was careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended by ſome concerned in it, and was therefore brought to Perfection: The <hi>Other</hi> Bill, that for <hi>Comprehenſion,</hi> was looked after very ſorrily; and if it had Paſſed as it was Drawn up, would have brought in, no Body.</p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:60562:59"/>
               <p>For inſtance, The <hi>Declaration of Aſſent and Conſent to the Book of Common-Prayer,</hi> required in the <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> was taken away wholly in this Bill, but the <hi>Subſcription</hi> required in the ſame <hi>Act,</hi> was taken away only in the latter part: And when in the former part there are theſe words, <hi>And I will Conform to the Liturgy of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>as it is now by Law Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,</hi> (which are really equivalent with the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Aſſent and Conſent</hi> to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of the <hi>Book,</hi> and it is to no more, than to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of it, the <hi>Declaration</hi> is required to be made, by the <hi>Act</hi>), it follows, that to take away <hi>One</hi> of theſe injunctions and not the <hi>Other,</hi> could be of no Signification. Upon notice hereof therefore gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſome Members of the Houſe, it was moved at the Committee to take away the whole <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,</hi> as well as the <hi>Declaration;</hi> and it being carried in the Affirmative, the Bill as it is here preſented, hath that Amendment.</p>
               <p>There are ſome few Additions more inſerted as neceſſary thereunto for the obtaining its end, the reaſons whereof appear in their own light, yet is it Judged fit, that publick notice be given of two or three of them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>One of them</hi> is the Parentheſis about the Beginning, where the <hi>Thirty-Nine</hi> Articles are impoſed on every Miniſter to Subſcribe, which notwithſtanding the Exception of Three of the Articles, do yet require more Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Whoſoever have read a Book, called, <hi>A
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60562:60"/>part of a Regiſter,</hi> wherein there is a Relation of ſeveral things in reference to the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> in Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days, they will find that there was nothing ſo greivous to them and exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them then againſt the Biſhops ſo much as the Subſcriptions of thoſe times, and the Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Articles was one among the reſt; which makes me wonder what our good men did now mean, to impoſe the <hi>Subſcription</hi> of theſe Articles ſo rigidly upon all, for the enjoyment of the benefit of either of their Bills, of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> or <hi>Indulgence.</hi> They know not really what it is they were a doing, for if the Perſecuting Spirit ſhould be raiſed hereafter about this Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the thing be ſo preſſed that all who Subſcribe not, ſhall be Proſecuted by the Law, there were like to ariſe <hi>greater troubles</hi> to tender Conſciences, and ſcruples more unanſwerable, then could be about the Cap and Tippet, the Surplice and Croſs, in thoſe dayes. The doubtfulneſs of many about the Ceremonies is not to be compared to a Conviction of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that a man muſt not Subſcribe to any point which he believes untrue. By this means therefore ſhould theſe Articles of the Church, intended for Peace, become the inſtruments of Torment, and be had in the greateſt Deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which conſequently will defame, and then ruine the Proteſtant Religion. There will be Perſecution in the Church, that's certain, for the Devil will have it ſo: There will be <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60562:60"/>Conſciences,</hi> that's certain, for <hi>God</hi> will have it ſo. When there are no other things then to trouble Mens Conſciences but this Subſcription, Exceptions and Scruples will be raiſed againſt theſe Articles; and it a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do not prevent them in their Bill by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent mitigation, they Act not like wiſe Men, and do not ſee Ten Years before them. The only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt this evil is to provide a liberty in both the Bills, that every Conſciencious Man that really ſcruples any of the Articles may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain his ſenſe, which if it ſhall not paſs unleſs it be allowed to be Orthodox by the Biſhop (or by two other Biſhops, in caſe the Dioceſan be partial) there can be no harm in it, at leaſt none in compariſon of this miſchief, which is to be prevented hereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another of them</hi> is about the Middle, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Orders.</hi> In the late Times, when the Biſhops were down, many were ordained by Presbyters and the Houſe was willing to allow thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as good in a <hi>Caſe</hi> of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> upon which account only the rigid Epiſcopalian will allow of the Miniſtry of the Reformed Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Sea: but there being others that have been Ordained ſince the return of the Biſhops, the Houſe made no proviſion for ſuch in the Bill, being not willing (we may ſuppoſe) to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance a neglect of the Biſhops <hi>out of that caſe.</hi> And what then ſhall ſuch do? There is an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to the <hi>Office,</hi> or <hi>Miniſtry it ſelf,</hi> and he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60562:61"/>that is <hi>Once</hi> Ordained to <hi>that,</hi> whether by Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters or Biſhops, cannot receive the Spiritual Power (or Character), or be made Miniſters, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:</hi> But there is a laying on of hands to the <hi>Work</hi> of that Office in regard to a new Charge, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> who were Miniſters before, and yet are ſeparated to that peculiar Work, (unto which they were called by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>) by the laying on of the Hands of thoſe who are named <hi>Act.</hi> 13. Such an Ordination now as this may be repeated, and is the only <hi>Medium</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of this dimculty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Third</hi> of theſe Inſertions is the laſt whole Clauſe concerning the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> the due conſideration whereof is the very main hinge upon which the whole matter of this <hi>Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> does turn. If Union it ſelf be neceſſary, it muſt be neceſſary to know what is the Bottom, upon which we can be United. In all Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilements between different Parties, the firſt thing that is to be found out, is a Medium for their Agreement. When we have found this, it muſt be conſidered, how far each Party can come up to that Medium, and then we can make the Accommodation. The Medium of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Buſineſs, at this time, between the <hi>Conformiſt</hi> and <hi>Nonconformiſt,</hi> is the <hi>Common-Prayer.</hi> Some Perſons (as is ſaid before) do hold, that a ſtinted Form of Prayer, and our Pariſh-Churches, are unwarrantable by <hi>God</hi>'s Word; who, though they may be <hi>Indulged,</hi> are
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60562:61"/>thereby uncapable of <hi>Comprehenſion.</hi> Others are ready to maintain the Lawfulneſs of both theſe; and the Enquiry about ſuch is, How far they can do that which is enjoyned? That is, How far they can Read the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> and how far they cannot Conform to it? This is the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Point, in regard to this Bill between the <hi>Conformiſt</hi> and <hi>Nonconformiſt.</hi> The <hi>One</hi> can Read <hi>all,</hi> the <hi>Other</hi> ſo <hi>much</hi> only as will ſerve for Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The <hi>Nonconformist</hi> now, who hold a Form of Prayer, and the Pariſh-Churches lawful, are, for the moſt part of them, able (through Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Merey) to Conform to the <hi>Ordinary Lord</hi>'s-<hi>Day</hi> Service, their Exceptions (which make the <hi>Liturgy</hi> to them unlawful) lying in other Parts or Moments of the Book. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, if the Bill may be hemmed up with the Clauſe here offered, it will do. Without that Clauſe, it is apparently imperfect: With it, it will be what we may call <hi>Perfect,</hi> that is, <hi>Perfect</hi> in its kind, ſo far as to anſwer its end, and bring in <hi>All</hi> of the <hi>Willing,</hi> and <hi>Many</hi> of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwilling,</hi> that go under the Name of the <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Perſwaſion.</hi> This being premiſed, the Bills (the Titles only as they were in the <hi>Houſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voluntarily omitted) are as followeth.</p>
